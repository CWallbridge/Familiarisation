Development of robot-human imitation program for telerehabilitation system,2019,"Proceedings - International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE",2018,,198-201,"Abiddin, W.Z.B.W.Z. and Jailani, R. and Omar, A.R.",,"This paper presents the development of a robothuman imitation program which will be used in a telerehabilitation system for children with disabilities. The purpose of this project is to provide an easier and more efficient way of providing a rehabilitation process for children with disabilities, especially for autistic children. The number of autistic patients needing rehabilitation is increasing rapidly and with the problem of shortage of professional therapist, this can be an alternative solution to assist the therapist during rehabilitation period. Therefore, robot-human imitation program is developed consisting of autonomous programmable humanoid robot NAO and Microsoft Kinect as the motionsensing input device. The imitation program is conducted by sets of instructions given to the patients to imitate certain pose done by humanoid robot NAO. Microsoft Kinect Sensor is used to determine whether the imitation follows the required criteria or not. Matlab software interacts with both humanoid robot NAO and Microsoft Kinect Sensor to perform the rehabilitation program. The number of trials needed to achieve the required imitation will be translated into points and these points will be uploaded into online database for record and evaluation process. © 2018 IEEE."

Towards the applicability of nao robot for children with autism in Pakistan,2017,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10515,,463-472,"Ahmad, M.I. and Shahid, S. and Tahir, A.",,"In this paper, we present a HRI study that reports on the potential of NAO as a socially assistive robot in Pakistan. Our findings generated through interviewing 2 parents and 5 teachers on the plausibility of using NAO robot as an interaction partner show that both groups welcomed the use of NAO at schools. They, however, were sceptical due to missing NAO’s facial expressions and certain body parts such as nose and lips. They also emphasised the importance of creating natural text to speech interface for the Urdu Language. Our findings taken from 7 autistic children to measure their level of social interaction during HRI revealed that children positively engaged with the NAO robot and showed a significant number of both verbal and non-verbal behaviours. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

KIBO is a programmable toy robot originally designed to teach coding and sequencing to neuro-typical children between 4 and 7 years of age. To assess its use in children with severe ASD, twelve participants were introduced to KIBO and engaged in a variety of activities with the robot over four consecutive days. Their interactions were observed on site by raters and simultaneously videotaped for later analysis. We performed a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis in two subjects who completed six or more of the eight planned KIBO play sessions. We observed that most of the participants showed sustained interest in the KIBO robot and increased the frequency of their interactions with adults across play sessions. Although the participants demonstrated only a limited understanding of programming principles during the study, they managed to manipulate the KIBO appropriately, engaged socially with the adults in the room and interacted positively with the robot during individual play. The findings suggest that the KIBO robot warrants further study as an engaging educational platform for children with ASD. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Influence of Reaction Time in the Emotional Response of a Companion        Robot to a Child's Aggressive Interaction,2020,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,12,6,1279-1291,"Alhaddad, AY and Cabibihan, JJ and Bonarini, A and Alhaddad, Ahmad Yaser and Cabibihan, John-John and Bonarini, Andrea",SPRINGER,"The quality of a companion robot's reaction is important to make it acceptable to the users and to sustain interactions. Furthermore, the robot's reaction can be used to train socially acceptable behaviors and to develop certain skills in both normally developing children and children with cognitive disabilities. In this study, we investigate the influence of reaction time in the emotional response of a robot when children display aggressive interactions toward it. Different interactions were considered, namely, pickup, shake, drop and throw. The robot produced responses as audible sounds, which were activated at three different reaction times, namely, 0.5 s, 1.0 s, and 1.5 s. The results for one of the tasks that involved shaking the robotic toys produced a significant difference between the timings tested. This could imply that producing a late response to an action (i.e. greater than 1.0 s) could negatively affect the children's comprehension of the intended message. Furthermore, the response should be comprehensible to provide a clear message to the user. The results imply that the designers of companion robotic toys need to consider an appropriate timing and clear modality for their robots' responses."
Comparing the Effectiveness of Different Reinforcement Stimuli in a        Robotic Therapy for Children With ASD,2020,IEEE ACCESS,8,,13128-13137,"Ali, S and Mehmood, F and Ayaz, Y and Khan, MJ and Sadia, H and Nawaz, R and Ali, Sara and Mehmood, Faisal and Ayaz, Yasar and Khan, Muhammad Jawad and Sadia, Haleema and Nawaz, Raheel",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"Recent research has shown reliability in robotic therapies for improvement in core impairments of autism. To improve the efficiency of communication using robots, this study evaluates the effectiveness of three different stimuli in a robotic intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder. Three different reinforcement stimuli presented in least-to-most (LTM) order introduced in this therapy using NAO robot are: visual (color variation), auditory and motion cues. The therapy was tested on 12 ASD children, 4 out of 12 children fall under mild category whereas 8 fall under the minimal category of autism. The experimentationwas conducted for 2 months. Total 8 experiments were conducted with 1 trial per week. Total 12 cues were given per trial, 4 cues corresponding to each category. In total 96 cues were given per subject, 32 cues from each category. The results indicate a general trend for linking a particular autism category with the most effective stimulus for that category. It can be concluded that visual cue (color variation) is the most effective reinforcement stimulus for children with minimal autism as 8 out of 8 i.e., 100% were more responsive to visual cues whereas for children with mild autism category, 3 out of 4 i.e., 75% are more receptive towards the motion stimulus. The parameters used for assessment were joint attention and the time eye contact is maintained. Single factor ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis of results with alpha is 0.05 and p-value 0.0342, F value is 3.7456 and F critical value is 3.2834. The test was performed on 96 (8x12) trails in total, therefore ensuring the significance and reliability of our results."
An Adaptive Multi-Robot Therapy for Improving Joint Attention and        Imitation of ASD Children,2019,IEEE ACCESS,7,,81808-81825,"Ali, S and Mehmood, F and Dancey, D and Ayaz, Y and Khan, MJ and Naseer, N and Amadeu, RD and Sadia, H and Nawaz, R and Ali, Sara and Mehmood, Faisal and Dancey, Darren and Ayaz, Yasar and Khan, Muhammad Jawad and Naseer, Noman and Amadeu, Rita De Cassia and Sadia, Haleema and Nawaz, Raheel",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"Robot-mediated therapies for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shown promising results in the past. We have proposed a novel mathematical model based on an adaptive multi-robot therapy of ASD children focusing on two main impairments in autism: 1) joint attention and 2) imitation. Joint attention intervention is based on three different least-to-most (LTM) cues, whereas the adaptive imitation module uses joint attention for activation of the robot. The proposed model uses a multi-robot system as a therapist without any external stimuli (from the environment) to improve the skills of the ASD child. Another novel aspect of this paper is the deployment of a multi-robot system for introducing the ASD child to the concept of multi-person communication. This is particularly useful as, unlike humans, robots can be more consistent and relatively immune to fatigue. Two different therapies of human-robot interaction (i.e., with and without inter-robot communication) have been conducted. The model has been tested on 12 ASD children, eight sessions for each intervention over a period of six months. The effectiveness of the model is validated by analyzing the cognitive state of the brain before and after the intervention with electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroheadsets. Moreover, results obtained using the childhood autism rating scale (CARS) to measure the effectiveness of therapy also support the conclusions firmly. The statistical results with the p-value = 3.79E-07 < 0.05 and the F value = 23.93 > 3.28 show reliability and significance of the data. The results strongly indicate significant improvements in both modules, along with a notable improvement in multi-communication skills of the participating children."

The research is based on a 3 step framework: 1) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-1 (HHI-S1), 2) Human-Robot Interaction, Stage-2 (HRI-S2), and 3) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-3 (HHI-S3). All three stages of the therapy consist of two command sets: 1) Controls commands and 2) Evaluation commands (auditory commands, visual commands, and combination of both). The concept of multiple robots is introduced to help multi-human communication and discourage isolation in ASD children. The joint attention of an ASD child is improved by the robotic therapy in stage 2 considering it as a key parameter for a multi-human communication scenario. The improvement in joint attention results in better command following in a triad multi-human communication scenario in stage 3 as compared to stage 1. The proposed intervention has been tested on 8 ASD subjects with 10 sessions over a period of two and a half months (10 weeks). Each session of human-human interaction (stage 1 and 3) consisted of 14 cues whereas 18 cues were presented by each robot for human-robot interaction (stage 2). The results indicate an overall 86% improvement in the social communication skills of ASD children in case of a multi-human scenario. Validation of results and effectiveness of the therapy has been further accomplished through the use of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score."
Effect of different visual stimuli on joint attention of ASD children using NAO robot,2020,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,953,,490-499,"Ali, S. and Mehmood, F. and Ayaz, Y. and Asgher, U. and Khan, M.J.",,"Interaction of autistic children with socially assistive robots have shown improvements in their impairments. This research focuses on one of the core impairments i.e. joint attention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using robot-mediated therapy. The study aims to compare the effect of different visual stimuli on joint attention. Two different visual cues i.e. rasta and blink by NAO robot are introduced. The evaluation parameters are total time for eye contact and number of eye contacts in response to generated stimuli. The experiment is conducted on 12 ASD children, 8 sessions for each cue over the period of 2 months. Each session consists of 8 trials of each category. This approach achieves 80.3% of accuracy for rasta while 65.1% for blink cue.

Effect of Paired Stimuli on Joint Attention of Children with ASD,2021,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,1201,,362-368,"Ali, S. and Mehmood, F. and Ayaz, Y. and Khan, M.J. and Asgher, U.",,"Recently, one of the prominent applications of human-robot interaction is in assistive therapy using humanoids for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These robotic therapies have shown promising results in improvising new communication methodologies, improvement in motor movements, joint attention and physical behavior of the children suffering from ASD. In daily life interactions, multiple types of social cues are used. The focus of this study is on the combination of most commonly used social cues i.e., visual, speech and motion used for improvement in joint attention of autistic child. The paired stimuli combination used in this research are visual plus speech (V+S), speech plus motion (S+M), and motion plus visual (M+V). The paired stimuli of V+S was presented using robot’s blinking eyes and the speech sound “Hello! I am NAO robot”. S+M cue consisted of waving hand with speech sound “Hello! Nice to meet you” and M+V cue was presented as sitting down of the robot with colored eye cue. The aim is to measure the responses of the children towards combination of different social cues in terms of Joint Attention (JA). The duration for which the eye contact is established also gives information about the response of a child towards a certain paired stimulus. The experimentation was carried on 12 subjects over a period of 2 months. The frequency of trials was one trial per week per subject. Each of the subject participated in 8 experiments. The results show that each combination of paired stimuli introduced to the children with ASD has same effect on joint attention of the child. The average accuracy for each type of paired stimuli was 66.23%, 66.40%, and 66.95% respectively. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Personalized Robot Interventions for Autistic Children: An Automated Methodology for Attention Assessment,2021,International Journal of Social Robotics,13,1,67-82,"Alnajjar, F. and Cappuccio, M. and Renawi, A. and Mubin, O. and Loo, C.K.",,"We propose a robot-mediated therapy and assessment system for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) of mild to moderate severity and minimal verbal capabilities. The objectives of the robot interaction sessions is to improve the academic capabilities of ASD patients by increasing the length and the quality of their attention. The system uses a NAO robot and an added mobile display to present emotional cues and solicit appropriate emotional responses. The interaction is semi-autonomous with minimal human intervention.Interaction occurs within an adaptive dynamic scenario composed of 13 sections. The scenario allows adaptive customization based on the attention score history of each patient. The attention score is autonomously generated by the system and depends on face attention and joint attention cues and sound responses. The scoring system allows us to prove that the customized interaction system increases the engagement and attention capabilities of ASD patients.After performing a pilot study, involving 6 ASD children, out of a total of 11 considered in the clinical setup, we conducted a long-term study. This study empirically proves that the proposed assessment system represents the attention state of the patient with 82.4% accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

Individuals with ASC can show a variety of atypical speech behaviours, including echolalia or the 'echoing' of another's speech. We herein introduce a new dataset of 15 Serbian ASC children in a human-robot interaction scenario, annotated for the presence of echolalia amongst other ASC vocal behaviours. From this, we propose a four-class classification problem and investigate the suitability of applying a 2D convolutional neural network augmented with a recurrent neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory cells to solve the proposed task of echolalia recognition. In this approach, log Mel-spectrograms are first generated from the audio recordings and then fed as input into the convolutional layers to extract high-level spectral features. The subsequent recurrent layers are applied to learn the long-term temporal context from the obtained features. Finally, we use a feed forward neural network with softmax activation to classify the dataset. To evaluate the performance of our deep learning approach, we use leave-one subject-out cross-validation. Key results presented indicate the suitability of our approach by achieving a classification accuracy of 83.5 % unweighted average recall."

It aims to encourage positive play behaviors such as gentle speaking and touching, with positive reinforcement through movement responses, and to discourage challenging behaviors, such as screaming or hitting through the removal of the reinforcing movements. This study evaluates the design by comparing a fully-interactive Auti to an active-only version, which does the same movements but does not respond to the child. Results from 18 participants indicate that the Interactive Auti does encourage positive behaviors more than the Active-only version. However, further design is needed around addressing problematic behaviors."

While this robot elicits JA in children, a coupled perception system based on RGB-D sensors is able to capture their behaviours. The proposed system shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of the use of social robots as assessment tools of ASD. We propose a set of measures to describe the behaviour of the children in terms of body and head movements, gazing magnitude, gazing directions (left vs. front vs. right) and kinetic energies. We assessed these metrics by comparing 42 children with ASD and 16 children with typical development (TD) during the JA task with the robot, highlighting significant differences between the two groups. Employing the same metrics, we also assess a subgroup of 14 children with ASD after 6-month of JA training with a serious game. The longitudinal data confirms the relevance of the proposed metrics as they reveal the improvements of children behaviours after several months of training."

We built a system that employed a Nao robot and a perception system based on a RGB-D sensor (Kinect) to capture social engagement cues. A JA induction experiment was performed in which children with ASD (N = 16) and matched TD children (N = 16) had a 3-mm interaction with the robot or with a therapist. Nao induced JA by gazing; by gazing and pointing; and by gazing, pointing and vocalizing at pictures. Both groups of children performed well with the therapist. However, with Nao, both groups had lower JA scores, and the children with ASD had a significantly lower score than the TD children. We found that (i) multimodal JA induction was more efficient in both groups; (ii) the 3D spatial world gaze exploration showed less accuracy; and (iii) the trunk position in ASD showed less stability in the 4 dimensions compared to TD controls.        We conclude that, in ASD, JA skill depends on the interaction partner, and implies a higher motor and cognitive cost. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The study attempts to find answers to whether robots as assistive tools can (i) profoundly improve achievement in learning and (ii) provide valuable learning experiences among this group of children. Using LEGO Mindstorms EV3, a robot was built and programmed to teach the basic concept of place value in mathematics. Eight children with ASD, specifically, four females and four males, participated in the single case study, and six special education teachers took part in the interviews. The children participated in both traditional and robotic intervention lessons and were assessed at the end of each session. The results indicate a positive increase in content knowledge and an improved disposition toward learning, thus demonstrating the potential utilization of robots as AT tools for harnessing classroom learning. Data from the interviews with teachers highlighted four valuable learning experiences that occurred in the classrooms as a result of the robotic interventions; namely, with respect to young children with ASD, the AT (1) promoted interest and engagement, (2) increased attention and focus, (3) triggered interactions and communication, and (4) created a happy and fun learning environment."
Social engagement of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in imitating a humanoid robot: a case study,2020,SN Applied Sciences,2,6,,"Aryania, A. and Aghdasi, H.S. and Beccaluva, E.A. and Bonarini, A.",,"Our study aims to compare the social engagement behaviors of the children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in interaction with a kid-size humanoid robot and a human partner in a motor imitation task on two children with ASD with high functioning. The evaluation measures (e.g., eye gaze direction, gaze shifting, completeness/correctness of the movements, initiation with/without prompt, verbal instruction, and time differences between starting/finishing the robot’s movement and the child’s movement) are extracted from the recorded videos of the trial sessions and analyzed to assess the engagement of the children in interaction with the robot or a human partner. The results indicate that the eye gaze duration to the robot, the frequency of the initiation without prompt, and the frequency of the complete and correct movements for Child 1 in the robot condition are higher compared to the human condition, while these criteria for Child 2 in the robot condition are slightly less compared to the human condition. Also, the frequency of the gaze shifting for Child 1 in the robot condition is lower compared to the human condition, while for Child 2, it is slightly higher compared to the human condition. Moreover, both children show desirable results in the case of the frequency of the required verbal instructions, and finished the movements before the robot and started after the robot most time.

In clinical trials, which are sensitive to outlier data, the goal is to learn a risk-averse policy to provide a trade-off between exploration, exploitation, and safety. In this paper, we present a risk-averse multi-armed bandit algorithm to solve a decision-making problem based on the social engagement behaviors of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The algorithm is carried out when children interact with a humanoid robot and imitate a sequence of the robot's movements. The proposed algorithm is based on the Best Empirical Sampled Average algorithm under Entropic Value-at-Risk as a risk measure to decide on the best sequence of movements that can improve the social engagement behaviors of the children with ASD while imitating the robot's movements. We provide a detailed experimental analysis to compare the performance of our proposed algorithm to some well-known risk-averse multi-armed bandit algorithms on some artificial scenarios and our real-world problem. The experimental results report that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competitors in terms of robustness, risk avoidance, and cumulative regret, promoting the social engagement behaviors of children with ASD when imitating a robot's movements. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."
Robot Assisted Diagnosis of Autism in Children,2020,ICMI 2020 - Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction,,,728-732,"Ashwini, B.",,"The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is cumbersome even for expert clinicians owing to the diversity in the symptoms exhibited by the children which depend on the severity of the disorder. Furthermore, the diagnosis is based on the behavioural observations and the developmental history of the child which has substantial dependence on the perspectives and interpretations of the specialists. In this paper, we present a robot-assisted diagnostic system for the assessment of behavioural symptoms in children for providing a reliable diagnosis. The robotic assistant is intended to support the specialist in administering the diagnostic task, perceiving and evaluating the task outcomes as well as the behavioural cues for assessment of symptoms and diagnosing the state of the child. Despite being used widely in education and intervention for children with autism (CWA), the application of robot assistance in diagnosis is less explored. Further, there have been limited studies addressing the acceptance and effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions for CWA in the Global South. We aim to develop a robot-assisted diagnostic framework for CWA to support the experts and study the viability of such a system in the Indian context. © 2020 ACM."

Six children with ASD and six TD children participated in this research, where Ryan showed them six basic expressions (i.e. anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) with different intensity levels. Participants were asked to identify the expressions portrayed by Ryan. The results of our study show that there is not any general impairment in expression recognition ability of the ASD group comparing to the TD control group; however, both groups showed deficiencies in identifying disgust and fear. Increasing the intensity of Ryan's facial expressions significantly improved the expression recognition accuracy. Both groups were successful to recognize the expressions demonstrated by Ryan with high average accuracy. © 2018 IEEE."

Many parents have developed chronic stress as they have to confront inappropriate behaviors from their child. In this study, we developed a daily routine game on the BLISS robot and investigated the use of the daily routine game on the BLISS robot in autistic children as well as children with special needs. We hypothesized that by taking care of daily routine for the robot, children could aware and perform their daily routine better. This daily routine game included four sections: brushing teeth, taking a shower, having a meal, and packing a bag for school. Six children with autism and other special needs between 3 and 10 years old participated in this study. All children played this game with the BLISS robot twice. The experimental results showed that participants could improve their development in both language and personal-social skills. Almost all children (5 out of 6) learned the rules of games in the first round. When the robot makes a request, they can do missions of the game by responding to the request by themselves. All children appeared to enjoy playing with the BLISS robot. The personal-social development evaluated by parents showed significant improvement after the experiment (p < 0.05). Therefore, playing a daily routine game as taking care of the robot could promote children personal-social development. © 2019 The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers - SICE."

Robots have been used in autism therapy, and to teach sign language to neurotypical children. The application of teaching assistive sign language - the most common form of assistive and augmentative communication used by people with ASD - is novel. The robot's function is to prompt children to imitate the assistive signs that it performs. The robot was therefore co-designed to appeal to children with ASD, taking into account the characteristics of ASD during the design process: impaired language and communication, impaired social behavior, and narrow flexibility in daily activities. To accommodate these characteristics, a multidisciplinary team defined design guidelines specific to robots for children with ASD, which were followed in the participatory design process. With a pilot study where the robot prompted children to imitate nine assistive signs, we found support for the effectiveness of the design. The children successfully imitated the robot and kept their focus on it, as measured by their eye gaze. Children and their companions reported positive experiences with the robot, and companions evaluated it as potentially useful, suggesting that robotic devices could be used to teach assistive sign language to children with ASD. © 2019 IEEE."

The study presented here involved observation, semi structured interviews and video analysis of six participants with intellectual disability interacting with a social robot in a series of five weekly workshops. The robot used for this study was Cozmo ©, a small AI toy robot with a vehicular appearance and movement, and animated eyes that it uses to display human emotions. Participants played games with Cozmo and took turns in controlling its movements in small groups. Through an inductive thematic analysis we identified themes of collaboration, competition, positive affect and attitudes of participants as well as the factors that affected their engagement with Cozmo. We detail characteristic behaviours within each theme. The study found that interacting with Cozmo resulted in positive affect, high engagement and collaboration. The aspects of Cozmo that had the most positive impact were the ability to play games with it and its humanlike relatable behaviour."

Examples of provider/receiver interactions of interest include ones between occupational therapist and patient, or teacher and student. We specifically consider tasks where the provider agent needs to plan a sequence of actions with a fixed horizon, where actions are organized along a hierarchy with increasing probabilities of success and associated costs. The goal of the provider is to achieve a success with the lowest expected cost possible. In our application domains, a success may be for instance eliciting a desired behavior or a correct response from the receiver. We present a linear-time optimal planning algorithm that generates cost-optimal sequences for given action parameters. We also provide proofs for a number of properties of optimal solutions that align with typical human provider strategies. Finally, we instantiate our general formulation in the context of robot-assisted therapy tasks for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

The success so far has been shown in solutions for a concrete task or a competence, and these solutions are seldom a truly multidisciplinary effort. In this paper we analyze the needs and the opportunities for combining artificial intelligence and bio-inspired computation within an application domain that provides a cluster of solutions instead of searching for a solution to a single task. We analyze applications of training children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with a humanoid robot, because it must include multidisciplinary effort and at the same time there is a clear need for better models of human-like behavior which will be tested in real life scenarios through these robots. We designed, implemented, and carried out three applied behavior analysis (ABA) based robot interventions. All interventions aim to promote self initiated social behavior in children with ASD. We found out that the standardization of the robot training scenarios and using unified robot platforms can be an enabler for integrating multiple intelligent and bio-inspired algorithms for creation of tailored, but domain specific robot skills and competencies. This approach might set a new trend to how artificial and bio-inspired robot applications develop. We suggest that social computing techniques are a pragmatic solution to creation of standardized training scenarios and therefore enable the replacement of perceivably intelligent robot behaviors with truly intelligent ones. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."

First, we feature a robot-centered environment that is technically designed to decrease the complexity of programming dynamic, synchronous and parallel interactive robot behavior to a level compatible with content creation. Afterwards, we apply the Cognitive Dimensions Framework (CDF) approach for evaluation of the usability of this environment that is employed to control a robot interacting with children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). A pilot test with therapists of two clinics followed by a test with adolescents with autism was performed. Participants in the pilot test performed tasks according to the different types of user activity in the CDF, and answered a questionnaire corresponding with the different dimensions. The results show negative attitude towards one particular dimension, but also high scores in other dimensions. As an additional validation of the usability of the environment, 9 adolescents with ASD could also create robot scenarios. We interpret these results as follows. In general, the therapists and autistic adolescents could program relatively simple behavioral scenarios with robots.

These care interventions can have a negative impact on the well-being of children. One option to improve a child´s well-being is through distraction. An experiment in a pediatric clinic is used to verify whether the children’s well-being can be improved by interacting with a humanoid robot. The experimental set-up involves the robot talking to the child and performing interactions at the request of the child or nursing staff. To measure the emotional state of the child before and after the intervention, the robot asks a direct, verbal question about the child’s state of mind. For further data about the emotional state of the child, the reaction is observed and documented by the researchers during the interaction with the robot and the nurse. In addition to this, the parents are interviewed by a questionnaire. Even though the evaluation of the collected data and observations did not show a significant improvement in mood after the measures, the observations show that the children overall react very positively to interactions with the humanoid robot. What this observation suggests needs to be further investigated, but it shows that a positive and interested basic mood was created by the humanoid robot. This positive effect was observed regardless of the age of the children or the degree of the disease."

We analyzed the facial expressions of children when they interacted with KiliRo using an automated emotion recognition and classification system, Oxford emotion API (Application Programming Interface). Results provided some indication that the children with autism spectrum disorder appeared attracted and happy to interact with the parrot-inspired robot. Short qualitative interviews with the children's parents, the pediatrician, and the child psychologist who participated in this pilot study, also acknowledged that the proposed parrot-inspired robot and the AMRM may have some merit in aiding in improving learning and social interaction abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder."

Here, we used computational modeling and a robot implementation to explore the functional value of action imitation. We report 3 experiments using a mutual imitation task between robots, adults, typically developing children, and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. We show that a particular learning architecture - specifically one combining artificial neural nets for (i) extraction of visual features, (ii) the robot's motor internal state, (iii) posture recognition, and (iv) novelty detection - is able to learn from an interactive experience involving mutual imitation. This mutual imitation experience allowed the robot to recognize the interactive agent in a subsequent encounter. These experiments using robots as tools for modeling human cognitive development, based on developmental theory, confirm the promise of developmental robotics. Additionally, findings illustrate how person recognition may emerge through imitative experience, intercorporeal mapping, and statistical learning. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

Among these, self-injurious behavior (SIB) is the most devastating for a person’s physical health and inclusion within the community. SIB refers to a class of behaviors that an individual inflicts upon himself or herself, which may potentially result in physical injury (e.g. hitting one’s own head with the hand or the wrist, banging one’s head on the wall, biting oneself and pulling out one’s own hair). We evaluate the feasibility of a wrist-wearable sensor in detecting challenging behaviors in a child with autism prior to any visible signs through the monitoring of the child’s heart rate, electrodermal activity, and movements. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of such sensor to be used on an ankle instead of the wrist to reduce harm due to hitting oneself by hands and to improve wearable tolerance. Thus, we conducted two pilot tests. The first test involved a wearable sensor on the wrist of a child with autism. In a second test, we investigated wearable sensors on the wrist and on the ankle of a neurotypical child. Both pilot test results showed that the readings from the wearable sensors correlated with the children’s behaviors that were obtained from the videos taken during the tests. Wearable sensors could provide additional information that can be passed to social robots or to the caregivers for mitigating SIBs. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In order to increase the degree of collaboration between humans and the robots in human-robot joint action systems, these robots need to achieve higher levels of interaction with humans. However, many social robots are operated under teleoperation modes or pre-programmed scenarios. Based on homeostatic drive theory, this paper presents the development of a novel collaborative behavior controller for social robots to jointly perform tasks with users in human-robot interaction (HRI) experiments. Manual work during the experiments is reduced, and the experimenters can focus more on the interaction. We propose a hybrid concept for the behavior decision-making process, which combines the hierarchical approach and parallel-rooted, ordered, slip-stack hierarchical architecture. Emotions are associated with behaviors by using the two-dimensional space model of valence and arousal. We validate the usage of the behavior controller by a joint attention HRI scenario in which the NAO robot and a therapist jointly interact with children."

The participants were 15 children with ASD (mean age: 4.96 ± 1.10 years) and 15 typically developing (TD) children (mean age: 4.53 ± 0.90 years). In addition to analyses of fixation time and gaze transitions, a longest common subsequence approach (LCS) was employed to compare participants' eye movements to a predefined logical reference sequence. The fixation of TD toward agent's face was earlier and longer than children with ASD. Moreover, TD showed a greater number of gaze transitions between agent's face and target, and higher LCS scores than children with ASD. Both groups showed more interests in the robot's face, but the robot induced a lower proportion of fixation time on the target. Meanwhile participants showed similar gaze transitions and LCS results in both conditions, suggesting that they could follow the logic of the joint attention task induced by the robot as well as human.

However, motor disorders have also been described, but not objectively assessed. Most studies showed inefficient eye-hand coordination and motor learning in children with ASD; in other experiments, mechanisms of acquisition of internal models in self-generated movements appeared to be normal in autism. In this framework, we have developed a robotic protocol, recording gaze and hand data during upper limb tasks, in which a haptic pen-like handle is moved along specific trajectories displayed on the screen. The protocol includes trials of reaching under a perturbing force field and catching moving targets, with or without visual availability of the whole path. We acquired 16 typically-developing scholar-age children and one child with ASD as a case study. Speed-accuracy tradeoff, motor performance, and gaze-hand spatial coordination have been evaluated. Compared to typically developing peers, in the force field sequence, the child with ASD showed an intact but delayed learning, and more variable gazehand patterns. In the catching trials, he showed less efficient movements, but an intact capability of exploiting the available a-priori plan. The proposed protocol represents a powerful tool, easily tunable, for quantitative (longitudinal) assessment, and for subject-tailored training in ASD."

Defining such individual profiles prior to the social interaction with a robot and working closely with caregivers could provide promising strategies for designing successful and adapted Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) for individuals with ASD. © 2016 IEEE."
Do Sensory Preferences of Children with Autism Impact an Imitation Task with a Robot?,2017,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,,,177-186,"Chevalier, P. and Raiola, G. and Martin, J.-C. and Isableu, B. and Bazile, C. and Tapus, A.",,"Imitation is of major importance during social interactions, would it be between humans or between a human and a robot. This is even more true when considering users with special needs. In this paper, we describe an experimental imitation task protocol using a robot Nao that we designed to assess whether sensory profiles of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) influence their capabilities to imitate or to initiate gestures that are going to be imitated. We based our work on the hypothesis that children with an overreliance on proprioceptive cues and hyporeactivity to visual cues have a greater difficulty imitating and improve their skills more slowly than children with an overreliance on visual cues and hyporeactivity to proprioceptive cues. Twelve children and teenagers with ASD participated in seven imitation sessions over eight weeks. As expected, we observed that children with an overreliance on proprioceptive cues and hyporeactivity to visual cues had more difficulties imitating the robot than the other children. Moreover, the repeated sessions revealed to have positive effects on social behaviors displayed by all children (gaze to the partner, imitations) toward a human partner after the sessions with the robot. We conclude on the possible impacts of such results on the design of social human-robot interactions for users with ASD. © 2017 ACM."

Methods: This study used an adapted alternating treatment design to compare the effects of robots and computers on learning action word symbols of AAC. Twenty symbols of action words in the 'Ewha-AAC symbols set (Park et al., 2014; Yeon et al., 2016)' were selected and divided into two groups: Set A and Set B. Symbols of Set A and Set B were exposed through a robot and computer during three phases, which were the baseline, experimental, and generalization phases. Results: All three subjects who were trained using the educational robot showed improvements in comprehending action word symbols. However, only two out of the three subjects showed improvements in learning with the computer. In the case of generalization phase, all three subjects who were trained using the educational robot and the computer showed improvements. Comparing the improvement levels between the two interventions in both phases, the effectiveness of the educational robot was generally higher than that of the computer. Conclusion: Both methods had positive effects on learning action word symbols of AAC, while the robot-based intervention showed higher improvement levels than the computer-based intervention. © 2016 Korean Academy of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology."

The clinical use of social or interactive robots is promising for enhancing the social skills of children with ASD. Teaching and intervention programs using humanoid robots for children with ASD are developing rapidly. In this study, a repeated-measures design was adopted to test the treatment effectiveness of a robotic intervention program; 14 students with ASD were recruited in this study. An individual-based social skills training program using the NAO robot was administered to each participant. Video recording was performed throughout the course of training. Systematic video analysis was conducted for the pre-intervention, mid-intervention, end of intervention and maintenance phases regarding 3 variables: frequency of eye contact, duration of eye contact, and frequency of verbal initiation. One-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was employed to demonstrate that the robotic intervention program significantly enhanced the eye contact (both frequency and duration) and verbal initiation of children with ASD. The robot served as a role model and facilitating agent to enable a therapeutic transaction between the child, environment, and activities to elicit self-initiated changes in the children with ASD."

Teaching and intervention programmes that use humanoid robots have been developing rapidly to improve the social functioning of children with ASD. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using a social robot to enhance the social skills of children with ASD. An ABA time-series analysis was used to examine the effects of the social robot on the social skills of children with ASD over 12 weeks. The study recruited 15 children with ASD from mainstream schools. A series of baseline measurements was taken at different time points in the pre-intervention phase, during which the children received social skill training from a human instructor only. In the intervention phase, the robot was integrated into the training programme to assist the instructor in conducting structured interactive social games, story-based activities, and singing or dancing activities. In the generalisation phase, the session switched back to the original training mode without the robot. The results of visual analysis and Tau-U analysis confirmed that the robotic educational programme was effective in improving the eye contact (in frequency and duration) and verbal initiation of the children with the human instructor. The improvement of the children was sustained even after the withdrawal of the robot in the generalisation phase. These implications on the practice and future development of using social robots for social skill training are discussed in this paper."
Long-Term Personalization of an In-Home Socially Assistive Robot for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders.,2019,Frontiers in robotics and AI,6,,110,Clabaugh C and Mahajan K and Jain S and Pakkar R and Becerra D and Shi Z and Deng E and Lee R and Ragusa G and Matarić M,,"Socially assistive robots (SAR) have shown great potential to augment the social and educational development of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As SAR continues to substantiate itself as an effective enhancement to human intervention, researchers have sought to study its longitudinal impacts in real-world environments, including the home. Computational personalization stands out as a central computational challenge as it is necessary to enable SAR systems to adapt to each child's unique and changing needs. Toward that end, we formalized personalization as a hierarchical human robot learning framework (hHRL) consisting of five controllers (disclosure, promise, instruction, feedback, and inquiry) mediated by a meta-controller that utilized reinforcement learning to personalize instruction challenge levels and robot feedback based on each user's unique learning patterns. We instantiated and evaluated the approach in a study with 17 children with ASD, aged 3-7 years old, over month-long interventions in their homes. Our findings demonstrate that the fully autonomous SAR system was able to personalize its instruction and feedback over time to each child's proficiency. As a result, every child participant showed improvements in targeted skills and long-term retention of intervention content. Moreover, all child users were engaged for a majority of the intervention, and their families reported the SAR system to be useful and adaptable. In summary, our results show that autonomous, personalized SAR interventions are both feasible and effective in providing long-term in-home developmental support for children with diverse learning needs."

A physiology-based affect-inference and adaptation framework was proposed, which could endow the assistive intervention technology with the capability of detecting the affective states of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and responding to them accordingly. Given the importance of affective cues in human-machine interaction and its significant role in autism intervention practice, this work marks an important step towards intelligent intervention systems that embody human-like functionality - affect recognition and adaptation. To account for the spectrum nature of autism and the differences of emotional expression, an individual-specific approach was employed for affective modeling. Two computer-based cognitive tasks were designed for eliciting target affective states considered important in autism intervention. Experimental results on real-time affect recognition and adaptation are presented based on a study of 6 children with ASD in a proof-of-concept experiment (i.e., robot-based basketball game). The preliminary results demonstrated that such an affect-sensitive adaptive system could hold promise for computer/robot-assisted autism intervention."

Children with autism have considerable difficulties in identifying and conceptualizing thoughts and feelings, which affect their ability to manage emotions (Sofronoff, et al., 2007). Objectives. By using robot-enhanced therapy (RET) we have tried to: improve the strategies they use in different social situations; modify irrational beliefs (based on Albert Ellis' REBT/CBT model); teach them adaptive behaviors in social situations associated with anger and sadness and to reduce the intensity of negative emotions. Method. 27 children with a primary diagnosis primary diagnosis of ASD, aged 6-12 years, were randomly assigned to either RET (12 children) or treatment as usual (TAU) group (15 children). Children in the RET group participated in six 2-h weekly group sessions. Results. Children with ASD from RET group showed statistically significant more rational beliefs and they had a lower level of emotional responses intensity, after treatment compared with TAU group. We did not found any significant differences between the two groups regarding: social knowledge and adaptive behaviors. Our findings showed also important gains from preto post-treatment for children with ASD that participated in the RET group. Conclusion. Our results may have important clinical implications for improving standard CBT for reducing emotional distress in children with ASD. © 2017, The Editors."

We aimed to investigate whether if children with ASD will illustrate more irrational beliefs and therefore more dysfunctional emotions and maladaptive behaviors compared to TD children. In order to test our hypothesis we have used a robot-based task since previous studies have shown that children with ASD could benefit of the presence of a social robot in the task. 81 participants were included in this study, 40 TD children (M =5.4, SD = 0.4) and 41 children with ASD (M =8.4, SD = 2.2). In order to measure our outcomes we have used a mood induction task: false feedback technique. In children with ASD group we have identified significantly more irrational beliefs expressed during experimental task compared to TD children. 41.5% of children with ASD have presented dysfunctional emotions during the robot-assisted task compared to TD children who expressed only functional negative emotions. TD children exhibited significantly more adaptive behaviors compared with children with ASD, who 39% of them engaged in maladaptive behaviors.

Effects of a Robot-Enhanced Intervention for Children With ASD on Teaching Turn-Taking Skills,2020,Journal of Educational Computing Research,58,1,29-62,"David, D.O. and Costescu, C.A. and Matu, S. and Szentagotai, A. and Dobrean, A.",,"Among social skills that are core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, turn-taking plays a fundamental role in regulating social interaction and communication. Our main focus in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a robot-enhanced intervention on turn-taking abilities. We aim to identify to what degree social robots can improve turn-taking skills and whether this type of intervention provides similar or better gains than standard intervention. This study presents a series of 5 single-subject experiments with children with autism spectrum disorder aged between 3 and 5 years. Each child receives 20 intervention sessions (8 robot-enhanced sessions—robot-enhanced treatment (RET), 8 standard human sessions—standard human treatment, and 4 sessions with the intervention that was more efficient). Our findings show that most children reach similar levels of performance on turn-taking skills across standard human treatment and RET, meaning that children benefit to a similar extent from both interventions. However, in the RET condition, children seemed to see their robotic partner as being more interesting than their human partner, due to the fact that they looked more at the robotic partner compared with the human partner. © The Author(s) 2019."

One of the main psychological factors supposed to underlie these difficulties is the lack or low levels of joint attention (JA) with the interaction partners. The use of a social robot in ASD interventions has received a lot of attention in the last years. The main objective of this research is to investigate if the JA performance of ASD children is dependent on the social cues that the robot uses in the therapy sessions. Three different types of social cues are adopted: gaze orientation, pointing and vocal instruction. Furthermore, our study aims also to investigate if the robot-enhanced treatment produces similar patterns in comparison with a standard human treatment. For testing our hypothesis, we have used a single case design involving five children with ASD who received 20 intervention sessions. The results pointed to a very consistent pattern across all types of sessions: using more cues for prompting JA increases the performance of the children. These findings emphasize the importance of using more cues, such as pointing, for increasing engagement and performance engagement in a child–robot interaction session. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Self-initiations were blindly coded, assessing video probes of all parent-child sessions using an event-recording system. General social-communicative skills were assessed with the parent- and teacher-rated Social Responsiveness Scale during intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Results using linear mixed-effects models showed overall gains in self-initiations during both Pivotal Response Treatment intervention groups (estimate = 0.43(0.15), 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13-0.73), with larger gains in functional self-initiations in children receiving robot-assisted Pivotal Response Treatment (estimate = -0.27(0.12), 95% confidence interval: -0.50 to -0.04).

The robot conducts a goal-directed based interaction to establish engagement between the child and robot in order to establish a beneficial learning environment for autistic children. An unsupervised Mixture Gaussian-based cluster method is proposed to detect the child's intention in real time to process the goal-directed task smoothly. The novelty of this approach is that does not require the use of any training data or a trained model to detect the child's intention. Our autonomous robotic system is tested with several autistic children at a School for the Disabled in Nagoya, Japan. The results of the initial interaction showed that the children enjoyed interaction with and feedback from the robot, which confirmed that the robot can be used as mediator or an object of joint attention. The unsupervised approach was able to detect the children's intention at every time segment to process the goal-directed task with a higher accuracy rate. The results of the goal-directed task showed that the proposed interaction was highly effective in enhancing their joint attention. Since most of the children attempted to imitate the robot's gestural behaviors and used a variety of learning patterns to attend to the robot's fingered object in the environment to obtain joint attention with robot. © 2009 IEEE."

In order to implement the above interactive scenario, the robot has to detect a child's intention at every time segment. For this purpose, a novel attention detection algorithm is proposed which is based on a Mixture Gaussian based unsupervised-clustering. A unique aspect of the proposed approach is does not require the use of any training data or models to detect a child' intention. Indeed, our algorithm is capable of detecting a child's intention when that child has a complex eye gaze pattern. These features are essential in the development of a robotic system for children with autism. The system was tested with autistic children who were attending a School for the Disabled. The results were quite impressive, revealing that the children were indeed attracted to the robot and had engaged in interactions with it for a lengthy period of time. Overall, the results showed that the children's joint attention skills improved when the number of interactive trials with them was processed. In addition, taking into account its joint attention performance with the children, the robot was able to change the interactive scenarios autonomously. The proposed unsupervised model was capable of detecting a child's intention at every time segment with a recognition rate of over 75%. ©2009 IEEE."

This paper presents the design, development, and application of a parrot-like robot as a screening tool to diagnose autistic children. The interactions of several autistic children with the robot have been observed and compared to the interaction of a group of normal children with the robot to determine the important behavioral features separating the autistic children from the normal ones. Based on these observations, we developed a descriptive research methodology to specify important and discriminating features for screening autism using behavioral aspects in social interaction, communication, and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. Our experiments show that there are significant differences between autistic and normal children pertaining to their communication with the robot, repetitive behaviors and sustaining attention. The results show the effectiveness of using robots in screening developmental disorders such as autism, highlighting the importance of Robot Assisted Screening (RAS) or intelligent toys in this field. We have determined 6 features extracted from the children’s behavior, and Random Forest method is used to distinguish between the autistic and normal children.

Educational Robotics is generally dedicated to study the effects of constructing and programming robots based on children's learning and academic achievement. Recently, we found that being engaged in progressively more challenging robot planning and monitoring (ER-Lab) promotes visual-spatial working memory and response inhibition in early childhood during typical development, and that an ER-Lab can be a feasible rehabilitative tool for children with Special Needs. The present study aimed to verify the efficacy of the ER-Lab on Executive Functions in children with Special Needs for the first time by using an RCT within their school environment. To pursue these aims, this study reports the results obtained in 42 first-grade children with Special Needs engaged in school Educational Robotics Laboratories (ER-Lab) to promote Executive Functions by means of enjoyable, intensive, and incrementally more challenging activities requiring them to program a bee-shaped robot called Bee-bot (R) (Campus Store). Several adaptations were done to meet different motor, cognitive, and social needs. All children were evaluated by means of standardized tests performed by each child before and at the end of the ER-Lab activities. Children with Special Needs had significantly improved inhibition skills, and children with attentional impairment had more benefits in their inhibition of motor responses tasks with respect to children with a language deficit. Results of the study and future perspectives on how ER-Lab programs could become a powerful tool in classrooms with children with special needs are discussed."

Contribution to the study of assisted interactions between an autistic child and a therapist by the way of a mobile robot in a play situation,2011,Assistive Technology Research Series,29,,497-507,"Etche Ogeli, R. and Pradel, G. and Malen, J.P.",,"Objective: the project ""RobAutisTIC"", works is conducted to evaluate the potential of a multimodal mobile robot to improve interactions and to study the child's social-communicative behaviours in this situation. The robot is used in a fun way to encourage interactive behaviours between the child and the therapist. We consider that child-therapist interactions are far more important than the child-robot interactions. The protocol we set up does not favour direct control of the robot by the child but only allows this control by the therapist. So, if the child wants to play with the robot, he/she must pass through a request to the therapist. The protocol uses 3 phases to i) demonstrate the robot's abilities, ii) show that the therapist may play with the robot, iii) encourage the triadic play. Main content: After a short introduction on autistic spectrum disorders, this paper quickly presents 5 projects involving robotics and autism followed by a brief section on the RobAutisTIC project. The main part focuses on the protocol, the behavioural coding, the experiments conducted with children and analyses a peculiar case and shows the facilitating action of the robot in the interpersonal interaction. Result: Most children are interested in the play and motivated. The main behaviour toward the robot is visual attention accompanied by other behaviours such as verbal/non verbal language sent to the robot. Conclusion: We cannot tell that this is the case for children who do not have a good level of verbalization; neither generalizes this analysis to all children involved in the experiments with the robot. Our future goal is to perform this analysis on several children with 3 experiments per child. This analysis will enable us, we hope, to demonstrate the possibilities offered by using a multimodal mobile robot in the interactions with an autistic child. In the longer term, we plan to quantify these interactions and to make the robot's behaviour adaptive. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved."

A study on an applied behavior analysis-based robot-mediated listening comprehension intervention for ASD,2021,Paladyn,12,1,31-46,"Geoffrey Louie, W.-Y. and Korneder, J. and Abbas, I. and Pawluk, C.",,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong developmental condition that affects an individual’s ability to communicate and relate to others. Despite such challenges, early intervention during childhood development has shown to have positive long-term benefits for individuals with ASD. Namely, early childhood development of communicative speech skills has shown to improve future literacy and academic achievement. However, the delivery of such interventions is often time-consuming. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are a potential strategic technology that could help support intervention delivery for children with ASD and increase the number of individuals that healthcare professionals can positively affect. For SARs to be effectively integrated in real-world treatment for individuals with ASD, they should follow current evidence-based practices used by therapists such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). In this work, we present a study that investigates the efficacy of applying well-known ABA techniques to a robot-mediated listening comprehension intervention delivered to children with ASD at a university-based ABA clinic. The interventions were delivered in place of human therapists to teach study participants a new skill as a part of their overall treatment plan.

Human–Robot Facial Expression Reciprocal Interaction Platform: Case Studies on Children with Autism,2018,International Journal of Social Robotics,10,2,179-198,"Ghorb and aei Pour, A. and Taheri, A. and Alemi, M. and Meghdari, A.",,"Reciprocal interaction and facial expression are some of the most interesting topics in the fields of social and cognitive robotics. On the other hand, children with autism show a particular interest toward robots, and facial expression recognition can improve these children’s social interaction abilities in real life. In this research, a robotic platform has been developed for reciprocal interaction consisting of two main phases, namely as Non-structured and Structured interaction modes. In the Non-structured interaction mode, a vision system recognizes the facial expressions of the user through a fuzzy clustering method. The interaction decision-making unit is combined with a fuzzy finite state machine to improve the quality of human–robot interaction by utilizing the results obtained from the facial expression analysis. In the Structured interaction mode, a set of imitation scenarios with eight different posed facial behaviors were designed for the robot. As a pilot study, the effect and acceptability of our platform have been investigated on autistic children between 3 and 7 years old and the preliminary acceptance rate of ∼ 78% is observed in our experimental conditions. The scenarios start with simple facial expressions and get more complicated as they continue. The same vision system and fuzzy clustering method of the Non-structured interaction mode are used for automatic evaluation of a participant’s gestures. Lastly, the automatic assessment of imitation quality was compared with the manual video coding results. The Pearson’s r on these equivalent grades were computed as r=0.89 which shows a sufficient agreement on the automatic and manual scores. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Multimodal cognitive nonverbal and verbal interactions: The Neurorehabilitation of autistic children via mobile toy robots,2013,International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences,5,3,214-222,"Giannopulu, I.",,"Multimodal cognitive nonverbal processes could be thought as a building block from which emotional and verbal expressions could emerge. With the intention to explore this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between autistic children and mobile toy robots during free spontaneous game play both quantitatively and qualitatively. Cognitive nonverbal criteria (eye contact, touch, manipulation, and posture) were analyzed, firstly in a dyadic interaction and secondly in a triadic interaction. The frequency of nouns and verbs including those which express positive emotion was figured out only in dyadic interaction. Once the cognitive nonverbal state between the child and the robot established, the child interacts with a third person displaying positive emotion. A positive correlation exists between multimodal cognitive nonverbal processes and verbal expression when the free game play with the robot is possible. This data suggests that in free spontaneous game play (i.e., ecological situation) the mobile toy robots could be used as a neural orthesis to enhance severe, middle and moderate autistic children's brain multimodal activity. The findings allow us to infer that this neural orthesis could pave the way for the development of synergistic dialogues between autistic children and human environment. © 2013 by authors."

Ordered interpersonal synchronisation in ASD children via robots,2020,Scientific Reports,10,1,,"Giannopulu, I. and Etournaud, A. and Terada, K. and Velonaki, M. and Watanabe, T.",,"Children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) experience persistent disrupted coordination in interpersonal synchronisation that is thought to be associated with deficits in neural connectivity. Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping. © 2020, The Author(s)."

In addition, the child uses the robot as a mediator to express positive emotion playing with the therapist.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of human social traits on the robot learning. We explore social traits such as age (children vs. adult) and pathology (typical developing children vs. children with autistic spectrum disorders). In particular, we consider learning to recognize both postures and identity of a human partner. A human-robot posture imitation learning, based on a neural network architecture, is used to develop a multi-Task learning framework. This architecture exploits three learning levels : 1) visual feature representation, 2) posture classification and 3) human partner identification. During the experiment the robot interacts with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), typical developing children (TD) and healthy adults. Previous works assessed the impact on learning of these social traits at the group level. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of individuals separately. The results show that the robot is impacted by the social traits of these different groups' individuals. First, the architecture needs to learn more visual features when interacting with a child with ASD (compared to a TD child) or with a TD child (compared to an adult). However, this surplus in the number of neurons helped the robot to improve the TD children's posture recognition but not that of children with ASD. Second, preliminary results show that this need of a neurons surplus while interacting with children with ASD is also generalizable to the identity recognition task. © 2017 IEEE."

However, further work is required to explore the impact of robots within the classroom, particularly for learners with intellectual disabilities (ID). This paper seeks to further explore the potential effects of robots on such learners through examining engagement and goal achievement within teaching sessions. Eleven participants with ID were recruited from two countries to take part in the study using an ABAB design where the participants acted as their own controls. An appropriate learning goal for each participant was selected by the teacher and equivalent control sessions designed seeking to achieve the same learning goal but without the robot. Engagement, using eye-gaze, learning goal achievement with and without help and goals not achieved provided the outcome measures from the sessions. This study found no significant difference between the robot and the control sessions for any of the outcome measures utilized suggesting robots are as effective as teaching tools as traditional methods. Through an increased sample size and a rigorously applied experimental protocol, this study provides new data and methodological considerations for further work based on the techniques applied in this study.

There is a lack of work examining the potential use of robots within formal learning. There is a lack of work utilizing experimental protocols to study the use of robots. What this paper adds Knowledge of the impact of robots on learner engagement using eye-gaze as an outcome measure. Knowledge of the impact of robots on goal achievement in pursuit of structured learning objectives. Knowledge of the experimental protocol and suggestions for refinement of the outcome measures in future trials. Implications for practice and/or policy Robots can be as effective as traditional teaching methods in promoting engagement in learning for students with intellectual disabilities.

A pilot study was conducted at a special needs school to examine the effect of robot KASPAR on making contact with children with autism. Nine children between 8 and 12 years of age participated in this mixed methods study with ABAB design. Children participated in 4 sessions, two with KASPAR and two with their teacher (usual care) resulting in total in 36 (video recorded) sessions. Main outcomes were micro behaviours of the children during sessions and teacher reactions based on video recordings. Results indicated that children showed significantly more non-verbal imitation (p value = 0.028), touched the robot more often than they touched the teacher (e.g. for a high-five) (p value = 0.012), maintained their attention longer (p value = 0.011), and were less often distracted (p value = 0.021) in the KASPAR sessions compared to the teacher sessions. The children made more positive verbal utterances as a reaction to the teacher than they did to KASPAR (p value = 0.028). A clinically relevant difference was identified in the amount of non-verbal behaviours shown and in the spontaneous use of verbal utterances on initiative of the child, both in favour of the KASPAR condition. As a conclusion, KASPAR was able to make contact with the children and to catch and hold their attention longer and in a more focused manner than the teachers. Moreover, children seemed to be at ease and enjoying the interactions with the robot, which constitute important requirements for further learning and implementation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."
Promoting question-asking in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorders: effectiveness of a robot intervention compared to a human-trainer intervention.,2013,Developmental neurorehabilitation,16,5,345-56,Huskens B and Verschuur R and Gillesen J and Didden R and Barakova E,,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of an applied behaviour analysis (ABA)-based intervention conducted by a robot compared to an ABA-based intervention conducted by a human trainer in promoting self-initiated questions in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: Data were collected in a combined crossover multiple baseline design across participants. Six children were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. RESULTS: Results revealed that the number of self-initiated questions for both experimental groups increased between baseline and the first intervention and was maintained during follow-up. The high number of self-initiated questions during follow-up indicates that both groups maintained this skill. CONCLUSIONS: The interventions conducted by a robot and a human trainer were both effective in promoting self-initiated questions in children with ASD. No conclusion with regard to the differential effectiveness of both interventions could be drawn. Implications of the results and directions for future research are discussed.

The setup consists of a number of sensory stations, together with two different robotic agents that navigate the stations and interact with the stimuli. These stimuli are designed to resemble real world scenarios that form a common part of one's everyday experiences. Given the strong interest of children with ASD in technology in general and robots in particular, we attempt to utilize our robotic platform to demonstrate socially acceptable responses to the stimuli in an interactive, pedagogical setting that encourages the child's social, motor and vocal skills, while providing a diverse sensory experience. A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, with a total of 18 participants (5 with ASD and 13 typically developing) between the ages of 4 and 12 years. We derive a measure of social engagement, based on which we evaluate the effectiveness of the robots and sensory stations in order to identify key design features that can improve social engagement in children."
Toward an Automated Measure of Social Engagement for Children With        Autism Spectrum Disorder-A Personalized Computational Modeling Approach,2020,FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,7,,,"Javed, H and Lee, W and Park, CH and Javed, Hifza and Lee, WonHyong and Park, Chung Hyuk",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"Social engagement is a key indicator of an individual's socio-emotional and cognitive states. For a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), this serves as an important factor in assessing the quality of the interactions and interventions. So far, qualitative measures of social engagement have been used extensively in research and in practice, but a reliable, objective, and quantitative measure is yet to be widely accepted and utilized. In this paper, we present our work on the development of a framework for the automated measurement of social engagement in children with ASD that can be utilized in real-world settings for the long-term clinical monitoring of a child's social behaviors as well as for the evaluation of the intervention methods being used. We present a computational modeling approach to derive the social engagement metric based on a user study with children between the ages of 4 and 12 years. The study was conducted within a child-robot interaction setting that targets sensory processing skills in children. We collected video, audio and motion-tracking data from the subjects and used them to generate personalized models of social engagement by training a multi-channel and multi-layer convolutional neural network. We then evaluated the performance of this network by comparing it with traditional classifiers and assessed its limitations, followed by discussions on the next steps toward finding a comprehensive and accurate metric for social engagement in ASD."

Behavior-based risk detection of autism spectrum disorder through child-robot interaction,2020,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,,,275-277,"Javed, H. and Park, C.H.",,This work presents a method to identify children at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder using behavioral data extracted from video analysis of child-robot interactions. Robots were used as a tool to elicit social engagement from the children in order to capture their social behaviors. A Convolutional Neural Network was used to classify the behavioral data as either at-risk ASD or Typical Development. The network performance was compared to two machine learning classifiers and the utility of the proposed method as a way to streamline existing diagnostic procedures was discussed. © 2020 ACM.

To facilitate communication, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is commonly used in intervention settingss. Different forms of AAC have been used; however, one key aspect of AAC is that children have different preferences and needs in the intervention process. One particular AAC method does not necessarily work for all children. Although robots have been used in different applications, this is one of the first times that robots have been used for improvement of communication in nonverbal children. In this work, we explore robot-based AAC through humanoid robots that assist therapists in interventions with nonverbal children. Through playing activities, our study assessed changes in gestures, vocalization, speech, and verbal expression in children. Our initial results show that robot-based AAC intervention has a positive impact on the communication skills of nonverbal children."
Lexical representation of emotions for high functioning autism(HFA) via emotional story intervention using smart media,2015,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,18,,1983-1988,"Jeong, M. and Kim, Y. and Yim, D. and Yeon, S. and Song, S. and Kim, J.",,"Children with High-Functioning Autism (HFA) have difficulty understanding and using emotional expressions. A variety of smart media, such as tablet PCs and robots, are being used to train children with autism spectrum disorders on emotional vocabulary use through language therapy. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of robot-based intervention (compared with PC-based intervention) on children with HFA, in particular, we evaluate the impact of using emotional stories to understand how intervention impacts the total number (and the diversity) of words to express their emotions. Our initial results revealed that children with HFA showed significantly higher performance when using robot intervention than PCs, in terms of the total number of emotional words used. Our study thus suggests that robot-based intervention can be used as a potential therapeutic tool for training children with HFA to increase their ability to use words to express their emotions."
Feasibility of using a humanoid robot for enhancing attention and social        skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,2013,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH,36,3,221-227,"Jordan, K and King, M and Hellersteth, S and Wiren, A and Mulligan, H and Jordan, Kimberlee and King, Marcus and Hellersteth, Sophia and Wiren, Anna and Mulligan, Hilda",LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,"This study investigated the use of robotic technology for promoting attention, communication and social skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Attention, communication and social skills were measured while participants played a memory card matching game (Face Match) using (a) a humanoid robot, (b) a Smart Board and (c) playing cards. Three participants with ASD and three with other cognitive impairments were recruited from a secondary school with a special needs unit. Participants were paired such that one of each pair had a diagnosis of ASD and Face Match was played in these pairs for similar to 15 min, with a game organizer present. On 3 separate days, video recordings were made as the participants played Face Match; a different game mode (robot, Smart Board, playing cards) was used each day. A system for categorizing attention, communication and social skills was developed that described 16 subcategories of interactions and intra-actions. In general, participants with ASD showed highly individualized patterns of behaviour in the three different modes. However, repetitive behaviour was reduced in participants with ASD when using both the robot and the Smart Board compared with playing cards. We show that it is feasible to use a robot to assist teaching of social skills to adolescents with ASD, but suggest that the robot features could be further explored and utilized.

We recruited 3 participants with ASD and 3 with other cognitive impairments from a secondary school with a special needs unit. In separate sessions for each game mode, participants played in pairs for about 15 minutes, with a game organizer present. We developed 16 subcategories of Interactions and Intra-actions describing social actions. Two of the 3 participants with ASD demonstrated reduced repetitive behavior when using both the robot and the Smart Board. Conclusion: robot technology shows potential for assisting teaching of social skills to adolescents with ASD, but the robot features should be utilized rather than using it as an animated computer."

However, as of now, no systematic studies have examined the specific cognitive mechanisms that are affected by robot-assisted training. This study used knowledge and methodology of experimental psychology to design a training protocol involving a pet robot CuDDler (A*STAR Singapore), which targeted at the specific cognitive mechanism of responding to joint attention (RJA). The training protocol used a modified attention cueing paradigm, where head direction of the robot cued children’s spatial attention to a stimulus presented on one of the sides of the robot. The children were engaged in a game that could be completed only through following the head direction of the robot. Over several weeks of training, children learned to follow the head movement of the robot and thus trained their RJA skills. Results showed improvement in RJA skills post training, relative to a pre-training test. Importantly, the RJA skills were transferred from interaction with the robot to interaction with the human experimenter. This shows that with the use of objective measures and protocols grounded in methods of experimental psychology, it is possible to design efficient training of specific social cognitive mechanisms, which are the basis for more complex social skills. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

Over a period of 10 weeks 7 children took part in a total of 111 individual play sessions with the Kaspar robot. Each child participated in between 12 and 18 sessions with the robot. The results from this study indicate that the play sessions with Kaspar appear to have positively influenced the behaviours of some of the children in specific domains such as communication and interaction, prompted speech, unprompted imitation and focus/attention. Furthermore, the children's teachers expressed positive views regarding the impact of the play sessions on the children and offered interesting suggestions about the ways in which the robot could potentially be used in everyday teaching tasks and were eager to obtain a Kaspar for their classroom activities. © 2019 Efstathia Karakosta et al., published by De Gruyter 2019."

The interaction with NAO lasted 20 minutes per session, during which Joe played the ""Animals Game"" with NAO and the therapist. In this game NAO asked the child to find a specific animal from a deck of cards and present it for feedback. A notable progress was demonstrated by Joe across sessions in terms of learning the animals in English, becoming more independent, initiating interaction with the robot, directing his gaze, and expressing affective feelings. Based on detailed video data analysis the study showed that NAO and the ""Animals Game"" helped Joe elicit desirable social behaviors beyond what was typically observed in his previous therapy sessions."
A Framework for Robot Learning during Child-Robot Interaction with Human Engagement as Reward Signal,2018,RO-MAN 2018 - 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication,,,461-464,"Khamassi, M. and Chalvatzaki, G. and Tsitsimis, T. and Velentzas, G. and Tzafestas, C.",,"Using robots as therapeutic or educational tools for children with autism requires robots to be able to adapt their behavior specifically for each child with whom they interact. In particular, some children may like to be looked into the eyes by the robot while some may not. Some may like a robot with an extroverted behavior while others may prefer a more introverted behavior. Here we present an algorithm to adapt the robot's expressivity parameters of action (mutual gaze duration, hand movement expressivity) in an online manner during the interaction. The reward signal used for learning is based on an estimation of the child's mutual engagement with the robot, measured through non-verbal cues such as the child's gaze and distance from the robot. We first present a pilot joint attention task where children with autism interact with a robot whose level of expressivity is pre-determined to progressively increase, and show results suggesting the need for online adaptation of expressivity. We then present the proposed learning algorithm and some promising simulations in the same task. Altogether, these results suggest a way to enable robot learning based on non-verbal cues and to cope with the high degree of nonstationarities that can occur during interaction with children. © 2018 IEEE."

Most broadly, enjoyment of activities or materials used in interventions has been associated with heightened improvements in the behaviors targeted by the interventions.

Robot-mediated increases in positive affect were found to be associated with production of spoken language directed to the clinician during robot interaction. We further found that robot-mediated increases in positive affect were associated with greater autism severity, particularly in the social affect domain, and with lower nonverbal IQ. Our findings suggest that robots may have a unique advantage in interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders by eliciting more positive affect, and that we should explore robot support for interventions with lower-functioning, affected individuals. © 2015 IEEE."

The main goal of this research is to provide a framework which translates the knowledge from the evidenced Pivotal Response Training to end-user tools, that allow therapists to program/adapt a training program mediated by a robot in order to use it in therapies. The overall structure of the intervention is based on Activity Theory which makes it easy to properly arrange robot actions and decisions. We appended a general end-user robot programming tool with PRT therapy-specific training structures which can be adapted with ease to create almost limitless learning opportunities utilizing a range of training scenarios or games. Pilot tests with children with ASD were performed to assess whether the robot assisted intervention created by this framework is ready for practical use. These showed that only minor adaptations were needed to increase the fluency of the robot-child interaction. © 2014 IEEE."

Prosocial behaviors, which are actions for the benefit of others, are required to belong to society and increase the quality of life. As smiling is a candidate for predicting prosocial behaviors in robot-assisted therapy, we measured smiles by annotating behaviors that were recorded with video cameras and by classifying facial muscle activities recorded with a wearable device. While interacting with a robot, the participants experienced two situations where participants' prosocial behaviors are expected, which were supporting the robot to walk and helping the robot from falling. We first explored the overall smiles at specific timings and prosocial behaviors. Then, we explored the smiles triggered by a robot and behavior changes before engaging in prosocial behaviors. The results show that the specific timing of smiles and prosocial behaviors increased in the second session of children with autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, a smile was followed by a series of behaviors before prosocial behavior. With a proposed Bayesian model, smiling, or heading predicted prosocial behaviors with higher accuracy compared to other variables. Particularly, voluntary prosocial behaviors were observed after smiling. The findings of this exploratory study imply that smiles might be a signal of prosocial behaviors. We also suggest a probabilistic model for predicting prosocial behaviors based on smile analysis, which could be applied to personalized robot-assisted therapy by controlling a robot's movements to arouse smiles and increase the probability that a child with autism spectrum disorder will engage in prosocial behaviors. © Copyright © 2021 Kim, Hirokawa, Matsuda, Funahashi and Suzuki."

Recent research on robot-mediated intervention (RMI) delivery has predominantly addressed social deficits in ASD with positive outcomes. Current literature has minimal focus on teaching children with ASD a skill not known apriori by the individual. Furthermore, it is unclear how to integrate robots in clinical settings because current RMIs do not adhere to Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) protocols. In this work, we investigated whether an RMI could be utilized to teach children with ASD a completely new language and communication skill they could not exhibit at baseline. We utilized a standard ABA assessment tool to first identify appropriate skills to teach children with ASD. We then developed, implemented, and evaluated an RMI intervention that followed standard clinical operating procedures in ABA and targets participants’ unique skill deficits. We examined the effects of the RMI training on teaching wh-question answering. All sessions were conducted with the SAR as the primary therapist using evidenced-based ABA human teaching protocols.

Social robots dedicated to assisting persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are rarely used in clinics. In a collaborative effort to bridge the gap between innovation in research and clinical practice, a team of engineers, clinicians and researchers working in the field of psychology developed and tested a robot-assisted educational intervention for children with low-functioning ASD (N = 20) A total of 14 lessons targeting requesting and turn-taking were elaborated, based on the Pivotal Training Method and principles of Applied Analysis of Behavior. Results showed that sensory rewards provided by the robot elicited more positive reactions than verbal praises from humans. The robot was of greatest benefit to children with a low level of disability. The educators were quite enthusiastic about children's progress in learning basic psychosocial skills from interactions with the robot. The robot nonetheless failed to act as a social mediator, as more prosocial behaviors were observed in the control condition, where instead of interacting with the robot children played with a ball. We discuss how to program robots to the distinct needs of individuals with ASD, how to harness robots' likability in order to enhance social skill learning, and how to arrive at a consensus about the standards of excellence that need to be met in interdisciplinary co-creation research. Our intuition is that robotic assistance, obviously judged as to be positive by educators, may contribute to the dissemination of innovative evidence-based practice for individuals with ASD."

For this purpose, we built Keepon, which is a small creature-like robot, and observed how autistic and typically-developing children (24 years old) interacted with it. Keepon was placed in their playrooms just as one of their toys, and tele-controlled by a human operator in a remote room; the children naturally and spontaneously showed various communicative actions to Keepon. From the longitudinal observations for more than two years (over 100 sessions of 3 hours) in a remedial institute and a preschool, we found that Keepon's comprehensive appearance and predictable responses gave the children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic interaction with Keepon, and also that the typically-developing children and some of the autistic children extended the interaction into triadic one, where Keepon worked as the pivot of interpersonal play with their caregivers. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a ""story"" of his or her personality and developmental profile, which is informative for the caregiver and the nursing staff to understand the child better, and is now being utilized for improving the remedial and educational services."

While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise they found in Keepon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these unfolding interactions suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that this motivation is impaired in autism. We assume Keepon's minimal expressiveness helped the children understand socially meaningful information, which then activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others.

The minimal design of Keepon's appearance and behavior is meant to intuitively and comfortably convey the robot's expressions of attention and emotion. For the past few years, we have been observing interactions between Keepon and children at various levels of physical, mental, and social development. With typically developing children, we have observed varying styles of play that suggest a progression in ontological understanding of the robot. With children suffering from developmental disorders such as autism, we have observed interactive behaviors that suggest Keepon's design is effective in eliciting a motivation to share mental states. Finally, in developing technology for interpersonal coordination and interactional synchrony, we have observed an important role of rhythm in establishing engagement between people and robots.

In the observational sessions, each of the children sat in front of Infanoid with his or her mother, gradually got into the loop of interaction spontaneously, where he or she played with the robot in a relaxed mood. We assume the relatively high predictability of Infanoid's behavior enabled the autistic child, as well as the normal children, to get into the playful interaction, from which the children could expand the horizon of social communications. This study suggests potential applicability of humanoids to remedial services as well as psychological investigation. ©2004 IEEE."
Interactive robots for communication-care: A case-study in autism therapy,2005,Proceedings - IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication,2005,,341-346,"Kozima, H. and Nakagawa, C. and Yasuda, Y.",,"The paper proposes possible use of interactive robots in the remedial practice for children with autism, who have difficulties mainly in interpersonal communication. For this purpose, we built a small creature-like robot, Keepon, which was carefully designed to get autistic and non-autistic children involved in playful interaction. We observed how autistic children (2-4 years old) interacted with Keepon without any experimental setting or instructions in a playroom at a day-care center for children with special needs. From the longitudinal observation for a year and a half (totally, over 500 child-sessions), we found that Keepon's simple appearance and predictable responses gave the autistic children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic play with Keepon, which would then expand into interpersonal communication where Keepon worked as the pivot of triadic play with adults or other children. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a ""story"" of his or her personality and developmental profile, which would not be explained thoroughly by a diagnostic label like ""autism"". © 2005 IEEE."
Social interaction facilitated by a minimally-designed robot: Findings from longitudinal therapeutic practices for autistic children,2007,Proceedings - IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication,,,599-604,"Kozima, H. and Yasuda, Y. and Nakagawa, C.",,"This paper reports our longitudinal observation of unconstrained child-robot interaction at a daycare center for autistic children. We used a simple robot, Keepon, that is only capable of expressing its attention (directing its gaze) and emotions (pleasure and excitement). While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise found in Keepon. The three-year-long observation suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that the motivation is impaired in autism. Autistic children, however, have difficulty rather in sifting out socially meaningful information (e.g., attention and emotions) from flooding perceptual information. Keepon, with its minimal expressiveness, directly conveyed socially meaningful information to the children, which activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that social filtering is one of the prerequisites for interpersonal communication and that robots like Keepon can facilitate social filtering and its development in autistic children. ©2007 IEEE."
A tactile robot for developmental disorder therapy,2018,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,"Krichmar, J.L. and Chou, T.-S.",,"Developmental disorders, such as Attention-Deficit- Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), have clinical symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms are often accompanied by tactile and sensorimotor impairments. We introduce a CAretaker RoBOt (CARBO) to standardize and automate therapy for children with developmental disorders. CARBO is autonomous, mobile, selfcontained, and focuses on tactile interactions with children. By providing a surface that encourages touch and a suite of interactive games, CARBO addresses impairments in tactile sensitivity and social interaction observed in children with developmental disorders. We conducted a small feasibility study with children having different development disorders. Children found the interactions with CARBO to be engaging for, and data CARBO recorded was sensitive to different impairments. The present study shows promising results for using CARBO as an automated form of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) in the future. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."
Enhancing Communication Skills of Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders While Maintaining Social Distancing Using Two Tele-Operated Robots.,2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,11,,598688,Kumazaki H and Muramatsu T and Yoshikawa Y and Haraguchi H and Sono T and Matsumoto Y and Ishiguro H and Kikuchi M and Sumiyoshi T and Mimura M,,"COVID-19 has affected many areas of daily life, including communication and learning. Social distancing is essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In these situations, teaching communication skills is essential for helping individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) reach their full potential. To provide communication education while maintaining social distancing, we developed a communication training system using a tele-operated robot. In this system, we prepared a PC and a robot for each participant. The participants were grouped in pairs and communicated with each other through the tele-operated robot. The objective of this study was to test whether this system can maintain motivation for training in individuals with ASD and whether our system was useful for improving communication skills. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the taking a class by teachers alone (TCT) group or robot-mediated communication exercise (RMC) group. Participants in the TCT group took a class about communication skills from their teacher. Participants in the RMC group, in addition to taking a class by teacher, were grouped in pairs and communicated with each other through the tele-operated robot once a week over 4 weeks (for a total of five sessions). In total, twenty individuals with ASD participated in the study. One-way ANOVA revealed that there were significantly greater improvements in being good at describing their thoughts to others, which was self-rated (F = 6.583; p = 0.019), and good at listening to the thoughts or feelings of others, which was rated by themselves (F = 5.635; p = 0.029) and their teacher (F = 5.333; p = 0.033). As expected, the motivation for training using this system was maintained during a session. Overall, this study revealed that our system was useful for improving communication skills (e.g., listening to the thoughts or feelings of others). Teaching communication skills under pandemic conditions is important, and this study demonstrated the feasibility of communication training using tele-operated robots."

A Pilot Study.,2018,Frontiers in psychiatry,9,,36,Kumazaki H and Warren Z and Swanson A and Yoshikawa Y and Matsumoto Y and Takahashi H and Sarkar N and Ishiguro H and Mimura M and Minabe Y and Kikuchi M,,"Research suggests that many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often demonstrate challenges providing appropriate levels of information during conversational interchanges. Considering the preference of individuals with ASD, and recent rapid technological advances, robotic systems may yield promise in promoting certain aspects of conversation and interaction such as self-disclosure of appropriate personal information. In the current work, we evaluated personal disclosures of events with specific emotional content across two differing robotic systems (android and simplistic humanoid) and human interactions. Nineteen participants were enrolled in this study: 11 (2 women and 9 men) adolescents with ASD and 8 (4 women and 4 men) adolescents with TD. Each participant completed a sequence of three interactions in a random order. Results indicated differences regarding comfort level and length of disclosures between adolescents with ASD and typically developing (TD) controls in relation to system interactions. Specifically, adolescents with ASD showed a preference for interacting with the robotic systems compared to TD controls and demonstrated lengthier disclosures when interacting with the visually simple humanoid robot compared to interacting with human interviewer. The findings suggest that robotic systems may be useful in eliciting and promoting aspects of social communication such as self-disclosure for some individuals with ASD."

Eight individuals with high-functioning ASD participated in this study. After the training sessions, participants learned to understand the point of view of the interviewer, which may contribute to increased recognition of the importance of gestures and the motivation to learn how to behave in a job interview. In addition, participants reported improved self-confidence.

Patient preferences regarding the appearance of robots are crucial for incentivizing them to undergo robot-assisted therapy. However, very little is known about how the realistic nature of an android robot is related to incentivizing individuals with ASD in an interview setting. In this study, individuals with ASD underwent an interview with a human interviewer and an android robot. Twenty-three individuals with ASD (age, 17-25 years) participated in this study. After the interview, the participants were evaluated in terms of their motivation to practice an interview with an android robot and their impression of the nature of the android robot in terms of humanness. As expected, subjects exhibited higher motivation to undergo interview training with an android robot than with a human interviewer. Higher motivation to undergo an interview with the android robot was negatively correlated with the participants' impressions of the extent to which the android robot exhibited humanness. This study brings us one step closer to understanding how such an android robot should be designed and implemented to provide sufficiently realistic interview training that can be of therapeutic value.

However, previous studies investigating the effects of interventions using robots on joint attention (JA) in children with ASD have shown insufficient results. The robots used in these studies could not turn their eyes, which was a limitation preventing the robot from resembling a human agent. Methods: We compared the behavior of children with ASD with that of children with typical development (TD) during a JA elicitation task while the children interacted with either a human or a robotic agent. We used the robot ""CommU,"" which has clear eyes and can turn its eyes, for the robotic intervention. The age range of the participants was limited to 5-6 years. Results: Sixty-eight participants participated in this study, including 30 (10 females and 20 males) children with ASD and 38 (13 females and 25 males) children with TD. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: the robotic intervention group or the control group. JA in the children with ASD was better during the robotic intervention than during the human agent intervention. These children exhibited improved performance in the JA task with human after interacting with the robot CommU. JA was differentially facilitated by the human and robotic agents between the ASD and TD children. Conclusions: The findings of this study significantly contribute to the literature on the impact of robots on JA and provide information regarding the suitability of specific robot types for therapeutic use. © 2018 The Author(s)."

This platform was developed based on Vygotsky’s socio-historical theory in order to promote the affective state of interest and joint attention scenes in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD leads the child to developmental deficit condition, with manifestation scale in the behavioral, communicative and in some cases cognitive domains. The interest and joint-attention deficits in children with ASD are also manifestations widely mentioned in the literature. The qualitative methodology is used with case study of multiple cases. An educational storytelling activity was developed using a product called Electronic Puppet, created on the Asistranto Platform. Four storytelling with Electronic Puppet was presented to four autistic students from 7th and 8th grade, limited to 16 cases. The results showed that Asistranto’s Electronic Puppet promoted over 80% of joint attention scenes, and an increase of three positive cases without technology to nearly 10 with Electronic Puppet, representing a gain of over 200%. In addition, 83% of the cases presented positive indicative of affective state of interest. This confirms the importance of Asistranto as a contextualized technological support for communicative and joint attention activities."

Therapists involved in interventions must overcome the communication impairments generally exhibited by children with ASD by adeptly inferring the affective cues of the children to adjust the intervention accordingly. Similarly, a robot must also be able to understand the affective needs of these children-an ability that the current robot-assisted ASD intervention systems lack-to achieve effective interaction that addresses the role of affective states in human-robot interaction and intervention practice. In this paper, we present a physiology-based affect-inference mechanism for robot-assisted intervention where the robot can detect the affective states of a child with ASD as discerned by a therapist and adapt its behaviors accordingly. This paper is the first step toward developing ""understanding"" robots for use in future ASD intervention. Experimental results with six children with ASD from a proof-of-concept experiment (i.e., a robot-based basketball game) are presented. The robot learned the individual liking level of each child with regard to the game configuration and selected appropriate behaviors to present the task at his/her preferred liking level. Results show that the robot automatically predicted individual liking level in real time with 81.1 % accuracy. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the affective states of children with ASD have been detected via a physiology-based affect recognition technique in real time. This is also the first time that the impact of affect-sensitive closed-loop interaction between a robot and a child with ASD has been demonstrated experimentally."

Feasibility of using a humanoid robot to elicit communicational response in children with mild autism,2013,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,53,1,,"Malik, N.A. and Shamsuddin, S. and Yussof, H. and Miskam, M.A. and Hamid, A.C.",,"Research evidences are accumulating with regards to the potential use of robots for the rehabilitation of children with autism. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the results of communicational response in two children with autism during interaction with the humanoid robot NAO. Both autistic subjects in this study have been diagnosed with mild autism. Following the outcome from our first pilot study; the aim of this current experiment is to explore the application of NAO robot to engage with a child and further teach about emotions through a game-centered and song-based approach. The experiment procedure involved interaction between humanoid robot NAO with each child through a series of four different modules. The observation items are based on ten items selected and referenced to GARS-2 (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-second edition) and also input from clinicians and therapists. The results clearly indicated that both of the children showed optimistic response through the interaction. Negative responses such as feeling scared or shying away from the robot were not detected. Two-way communication between the child and robot in real time significantly gives positive impact in the responses towards the robot. To conclude, it is feasible to include robot-based interaction specifically to elicit communicational response as a part of the rehabilitation intervention of children with autism. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Engaging in joint attention, which is the shared focus of two individuals on some object of interest, is a strong cue of typically developing children, and the lack thereof can be an indicator of autism spectrum disorder or other pervasive developmental disorder. Therefore, the goal of many psychology experiments with children is to determine when, for how long, and towards what the child looks after some bid for attention or reaction. While much research looks for the orientation of faces based on frontal or profile pictures, or non-morphable, larger objects like cars, fewer studies work in the setting of minimally-invasive overhead person gaze or orientation detection. To automatically detect the child's orientation during a human-robot interaction experiment, we mount a camera on the ceiling of a child development laboratory and analyze the video footage. We use multiple kernel learning on eight potential orientation directions to determine a child's orientation during the video recorded interaction. We also contribute the labelled dataset we used on this challenging problem. © 2017 IEEE."

Facilitating Social Play for Children with PDDs: Effects of Paired Robotic Devices.,2017,Frontiers in psychology,8,,1029,Matsuda S and Nunez E and Hirokawa M and Yamamoto J and Suzuki K,,"Interacting with toys and other people is fundamental for developing social communication skills. However, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by having a significant impairment in social interaction, which often leads to deficits in play skills. For this reason, methods of teaching play skills to young children with ASD have been well documented. Although previous studies have examined a variety of instructional strategies for teaching skills, few studies have evaluated the potential of using robotic devices. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether automatic feedback provided by colored lights and vibration via paired robotic devices, COLOLO, facilitates social play behaviors in children with ASD. We also explore how social play relates to social interaction. COLOLO is a system of paired spherical devices covered with soft fabric. All participants in this study were recruited as volunteers through the Department of Psychology at Keio University. The pilot study included three participants diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs; 5- to 6-year-old boys), and compared experimental conditions with and without automatic feedback from the devices (colored lights and vibration). The results indicated that the participants in the condition that included feedback from the devices exhibited increased rates of ball contact and looking at the therapist's ball, but did not exhibit increased rates of eye contact or positive affect. In the experimental study, a systematic replication of the pilot study was performed with three other participants diagnosed with PDDs (3- to 6-year-old boys), using an A-B-A-B design. Again, the results demonstrated that, in the condition with colored lights and vibration, the children increased ball contact as well as looking at the therapist's ball. However, the results did not show the effect of automatic feedback consistently for three children. These findings are discussed in terms of the potential of paired robotic devices as a method to facilitate social play for children with ASD."

One promising application of the socially assistive robots is in autism therapy, where robots are employed to enhance verbal and nonverbal skills (e.g. eye-gaze attention, facial expression mimicry) of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One important question is 'How the gaze responses of individuals with ASD differ from that of Typically Developing (TD) peers when interacting with a robot?' We present the results of our recent studies for modeling and analyzing the gaze pattern of children with ASD when they interact with a robot called NAO. This paper reports the differences of gaze responses of TD and ASD group in two conversational contexts: Speaking versus Listening. We used Variable-order Markov Model (VMM) to discover the temporal gaze directional patterns of ASD and TD groups. The results reveal that the gaze responses of the TD individuals in speaking and listening contexts, can be best modeled by VMM with order zero and three, respectively. As we expected, the result show that the temporal gaze patterns of typically developed children are varying when the role in the conversational context is changed. However for the ASD individuals for both conversational contexts the VMM with order one could best fit the data. Overall, the results conclude that VMM is a powerful technique to model different gaze responses of TD and ASD individuals in speaking and listening contexts. © 2014 IEEE."

As there are limited investigations for utilizing robots in social and behavioral treatments of individuals with ASD, we designed and evaluated a robot-based intervention protocol using a social robot (NAO) to deliver behavioral training mechanism for children with ASD. Results of our pilot study on seven verbal children with high functioning autism show behavioral response improvement, including pointing and facial expression recognition in the majority of the participants as a consequence of the behavioral intervention delivered directly through the robot.

The robot was designed to be of spherical shape with the appearance of a common playground object to make it easier to introduce this to the children. The experiment to test this study was designed to include parallel play as well as collaborative play. A mobile application was used to remotely control the robot as to make the introduction and interaction with a foreign object easier for the children. The child's acceptance of the robot, their reaction to its movements, the robot's ability to attract the child when they are distracted, and improvement of their motor skills were measured as well as the child's engagement with the robot. The results of this study showed that the children diagnosed with ASD are open to interact with social robots and that through continuous exposure, the motor skills and social interaction of these children can be improved.

The proposed multi-robot system includes sequential and simultaneous actuations of robots dealing with single and multi-robot communication. Results indicate that most of the autistic children initiate joint attention from right to left vision space. Similarly, for imitation, robot at right visual space is imitated and focused more. These findings are also supported by the results obtained from the dominance of brain and number of eye contacts. Eight participants, five males and three females, participated in this research. Six participants belong to minimal while two belong to mild case on autism spectrum. Minimal cases of autism indicated proper dominance of either left or right visual space and hence the respective dominance of hemispheres of brain too. While mild cases of autism showed balanced performance in visual space but distinguishable dominance of hemispheres of brain. The overall average followed imitation accuracy for robot at right visual space is 83.49 % while for robot at left visual space is 61.53 %. Similarly, overall average eye contacts with robot at right visual space are 16.47 and for robot at left visual space are 14.95 per minute.

One of the most important social skills that are affected by ASD is the ability to pay attention; ASD introduces unnecessary temporal delays in the attentional behavior of children toward external stimuli. This research focuses on identifying the effect of different social stimuli from robotic agents to assess the attentional behavior of children with ASD. Latencies in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid to a stimulus are defined as indexes of attentional behaviors for children with ASD. Nine children with ASD (seven males and two females, mean: 7.57 ± 2.57 years) that had minimal to no symptoms of autism participated in this study. Two robotic agents presented visual, speech, and motion social stimuli to the participants. Regarding social stimuli, a significant effect on the latency in shifting attention (χ (2) = 9.55, p = 0.008) and the number of attentions paid (χ2(2) = 9.56, p = 0.008) was observed in children with ASD. The speech stimulus captured the children's attention faster than the visual and motion stimuli in terms of latency in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found for some pairs of stimuli among visual, speech, and motion stimuli for latencies in shifting attention, as well as the number of attentions paid using Pearson's correlation analysis.

Robotic systems have been designed and applied to help children with ASD improve their RJA skills. One of the most important goals of robot-assisted intervention is helping children generalize social interaction skills to interact with other people. Thus predicting children's human-human interaction (HHI) performance based on their human-robot interaction (HRI) process is an important task. However, to the best of our knowledge, little research exists exploring this topic. The Early Social-Communication Scales (ESCS) test is a measurement of nonverbal social skills, including RJA, for young children. We conducted two longitudinal user studies with a robot-mediated RJA system in young children with ASD, followed by HHI sessions consisting of ESCS administration. In this paper, we present findings regarding how to predict participants' RJA performance in HHI based on their head pose patterns in HRI, under a semi-supervised machine learning framework. As a three-class classification problem, we achieved a micro-averaged accuracy of 73.5%, which indicates the potential effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this study we introduce a system composed of multiple spherical devices, as well as the design of a turn taking activity using those devices. In previous studies turn taking was found to be an important social skill for development and engaging in activities with others. To evaluate the system performance, a single case experiment with a boy with ASD and the developed device was done. During the activity, the device had two different roles: to engage the child on the turn taking activity and to provide information to the therapist that describe the child's behavior. We could successfully collect quantitative data that represent turn taking as well as we could observe how does the boy manipulate and interact with the device. Based on the results, we are motivated to keep exploring the potential application of devices mediated activities for children with ASD."
Investigating Interactions between Students with Mild Mental Retardation        and Humanoid Robot in Terms of Feedback Types,2017,EGITIM VE BILIM-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE,42,191,109-138,"Ozdemir, D and Karaman, S and Ozdemir, Durmus and Karaman, Selcuk",TURKISH EDUCATION ASSOC,"In Turkey and the world, some studies are carried out to support student's cognitive and social development with activities such as robot competitions and robot camps. Additionally, technological materials for robot-aided learning environment have started to become widespread. Robot-aided applications can provide multimedia as well as interactions such as motion, appearance, and touch to the learners. Because of these abilities, robots have an important potential especially for education of mentally retarded students. The studies, in which activities including feedbacks given by humanoid robots are designed and applied, will make contributions to this area for revealing the potential and improving the effective applications like integration of technology into the field of education and the creation of innovative learning environments. The purpose of this study was to examine interactions of students with mild mental retardation in terms of feedback types in the robot-assisted learning environment, analyse participations of students with mild mental retardation in this environment activities and compare the investigation of interactions in terms of feedback types. In this way, it was aimed to create design proposals for feedback types in robot-assisted learning environment to be designed for students with mental disability. Humanoid robot assisted activities prepared according to ASSURE instructional design method. This study was conducted in six sessions on six students with mild mental retardation who were registered in the Guidance and Research Centre (GRC). Being one of the qualitative research methods, case study was used in this study. In the study, data were gathered by carrying out interviews and observations. In order to reach the notions and correlations explaining the data, the methods of content analysis and descriptive analysis were used. In this study, it was observed that the students met the humanoid robot's feedbacks pleasantly and excitedly, they commented and responded amusedly. The use of feedbacks in this study drew the students' attentions and increased their motivation. However, there were differences in terms of reaction types in their reactions to the robot's feedback. While feedbacks considered as the most remarkable and interacting by the students were arm, bodily and voice feedbacks, the least responded feedbacks were head movement feedbacks and feedbacks formed through the robot's screen. As a result of interviews made with the teachers, it was specified that humanoid robot make positive contributions to the student motivation and teaching of the lesson. The teachers stated that according to general evaluation forms and the results of their measurements, robot aided education was useful and helpful at the classroom management, provided quick and permanent learning, and increased motivation and participation of activities."

Are Children with ASD more Prone to Test the Intentions of the Robonova Robot Compared to a Human?,2015,International Journal of Social Robotics,7,5,629-639,"Peca, A. and Simut, R. and Pintea, S. and V and erborght, B.",,"This study proposes an innovative device specifically designed for investigating the ability of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to test the intention of a partner in a dyadic interactive game. Twenty one children with ASD were exposed to both a contingent and a noncontingent interaction condition with either a human agent or the Robonova robot as partners. The statistical analysis indicates a strong tendency toward a significant higher frequency of testing behaviors in the robot noncontingent condition and no difference between the two groups (robot/human) for the contingent condition. Children with ASD showed significantly more eye gaze to the robot compared to the human agent in both contingent and noncontingent conditions, but no difference in affect was found. The high level of initiations recorded in all conditions suggests that the game has a high motivational value for ASD children.

EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS WITH ASD: EMOTION PRODUCTION AND        RECOGNITION THROUGH THE BEE-BOT ROBOT,2019,EDULEARN19: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING        TECHNOLOGIES,,,3750-3758,"Perez, E and Gilabert, A and Lorenzo, G and Lorenzo, A and Lledo, A and Perez, E. and Gilabert, A. and Lorenzo, G. and Lorenzo, A. and Lledo, A.",IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,"In last two decades, the worldwide number of cases of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) diagnosed have increased drastically. ASD is a developmental disorder characterized by impairments in communication and social interactions and repetitive behaviour. These impairments can be translated into difficulties of attention and executive learning, general cognition or oral language, academic skills and social skills. Specifically, social skills include social imitation, social interaction rules, emotion production and recognition. All of this makes that they perceive reality in a different way and, therefore, inclusion into society for students with ASD is complicated by these difficulties. The teaching of social skills for these students continues to be a challenge. Nevertheless, during the last decade irruption of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) has provided many new options for the educative intervention of people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Three main categories involve ITC-based interventions which are: iPods and iPads Apps, serious games and robots. In this way, among these types of ICT, a growing intervention method based on Social Assistance Robots (SAR) is being developed. The main characteristics of SAR include that can express and/or perceive emotions, can establish verbal and non-verbal communications and they can learn social skills. In this sense, one of the biggest advantages is based on their capacity to programme to respond to different social situations. Robotic assisted therapy not only perfectly aligns with the methodological principles that should guide the teaching-learning process of these students (individualized intervention, sequence of activities, active experiences and predictive environments), but also with the educational needs of these students. This rapid advance in robotics, its good results, the complexity of the educational need and the increase in cases of ASD, make it necessary to include this type of intervention in educational contexts. Many recent researches have shown positive outcomes of robots as social mediators to improve social and communication skills. In this way, robotics is constituted as a new path of educational intervention. Nevertheless, the possibility of using robots in educational contexts is limited due to its high costs and the lack of availability that is normally limited to the clinical and private environment. To overcome these aspects, this study uses the robot Bee-Bot which unites its low cost, its ease and its versatility of use. The main aim of this research has been to study how the use of the Bee-Bot robot can facilitate emotion recognition and production in ASD students. Specifically, this research has focused in one emotion: happiness. By conducting an exploratory study involving two children whose age is 6 years old, results provided some indicators that children with ASD have a great affinity with robots. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the literature on the impact of robots on the learning of social skills"

Due to the absence of any physiological tests, the outcome depends solely on the expertise of the clinician, which takes years to acquire. Complicating the matter further, research has shown that inter-rater reliability can be very low, even among experienced clinicians. As an attempt to facilitate the diagnostic process and make it more objective, this paper proposes a robot-assisted diagnostic protocol. The expected benefit of using a robot is twofold: the robot always performs its actions in a predictable and consistent way, and it can use its sensors to catch aspects of a child's behavior that a human examiner can miss. In this paper, we describe four tasks from the widely accepted ADOS protocol, that have been adapted to make them suitable for the Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot. These tasks include evaluating the child's response to being called by name, symbolic and functional imitation, joint attention and assessing the child's ability to simultaneously communicate on multiple channels. All four tasks have been implemented on the robot's onboard computer and are performed autonomously. As the main contribution of the paper, we present the results of the initial batch of four clinical trials of the proposed robot assisted diagnostic protocol, performed on a population of preschool children. The results of the robot's observations are benchmarked against the findings of experienced clinicians. Emphasis is placed on evaluating robot performance, in order to assess the feasibility of a robot eventually becoming an assistant in the diagnostic process. The obtained results indicate that the use of robots as autism diagnostic assistants is a promising approach, but much work remains to be done before they become useful diagnostic tools."

In this work we propose the Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework for such protocol which enables the robot to infer information about the state of the child based on observations of child's behavior. We extend our previous work by developing a protocol POMDP model which uses tasks of the protocol as actions. We devise a method to interface protocol and task models by using belief at the end of a task to generate observations for the protocol POMDP, resulting in a hierarchical POMDP framework. We evaluate our approach through an exploratory study with fifteen children (seven typically developing and eight with ASD)."

Occurrence of low agreement rates between different clinicians when evaluating a child suggests that there exists a need for a more objective approach to diagnostics. To that end, we developed a robot-assisted ASD diagnostic protocol. In this work the focus is on robot reasoning for tasks of the protocol. We propose the mixed observability Markov decision process models for tasks which infer information about the state of a child based on observations of child’s behavior. In order to formulate observation probabilities of task models, ASD experts are surveyed and their knowledge is encoded in the observation probabilities of task models. Expert knowledge also allowed for implementation of child behavioral models which are used to validate and tune developed models. Following the successful validation through simulations of child–robot interaction using child behavioral models, task models are validated through experimental sessions with six typically developing children and eight children with ASD. Results obtained through experiments show that the robot is capable of correctly identifying the behavior of the child within the diagnostic tasks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."

Imitation plays a key role in the development of social skills at a young age, and studies have shown that the ability to imitate is impaired in children with ASD. Therefore, we expect imitation-based tasks to have diagnostic value. In this paper, we introduce two novel elements of human-robot interaction in the context of autism diagnostics. Instead of pure motoric imitation, we propose imitation tasks involving real objects in the environment. The introduction of physical objects strongly emphasizes joint attention skills, another area that is typically impaired in children with ASD. Furthermore, we present simple object detection, manipulation, tracking and gesture recognition algorithms, suitable for real-Time, onboard execution on the small-scale humanoid robot NAO. The proposed system paves the way for fully autonomous execution of diagnostic tasks, which would simplify the deployment of robotic assistants in clinical settings.

Robotic movement elicits visuomotor priming in children with autism,2008,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,46,2,448-454,"Pierno, AC and Mari, M and Lusher, D and Castiello, U and Pierno, Andrea C. and Mari, Morena and Lusher, Dean and Castiello, Umberto",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"The ability to understand another person's action and, if needed, to imitate that action, is a core component of human social behaviour. Imitation skills have attracted particular attention in the search for the underlying causes of the social difficulties that characterize autism. In recent years, it has been reported that people with autism can bypass some of their social deficits by interacting with robots. However, the robot preference in terms of imitation has yet to be proved. Here we provide empirical evidence that interaction with robots can trigger imitative behaviour in children with autism. We compared a group of high functioning children with autism with a group of typically developing children in a visuomotor priming experiment. Participants were requested to observe either a human or a robotic arm model performing a reach-to-grasp action towards a spherical object. Subsequently, the observers were asked to perform the same action towards the same object. Two 'control' conditions in which participants performed the movement in the presence of either the static human or robot model were also included. Kinematic analysis was conducted on the reach-to-grasp action performed by the observer. Our results show that children with autism were facilitated - as revealed by a faster movement duration and an anticipated peak velocity - when primed by a robotic but not by a human arm movement. The opposite pattern was found for normal children. The present results show that interaction with robots has an effect on visuomotor priming processes. These findings suggest that in children with autism the neural mechanism underlying the coding of observed actions might be tailored to process socially simpler stimuli. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, parents seem to accept the inclusive practices, but when it comes to their children's participation in such activities, many appear to be skeptical about allowing their children to participate, stating most of the times fear that their children will adopt possible negative behaviors of children with disabilities or their children's education will be impeded. In an intervention for the inclusion of three ASD children, with Daisy Robot, three more children of TD, also participated. All TD became more motivated to engage in actions under the guidance of the robot, and their scores on almost all of the skills were perfected after the interventions. Most importantly, TD children's participation worked for the benefit of their own development since no misbehaviors were observed or other issues arose, suggesting that their education and training were impeded.

Results: Overall, our data indicate that using the social robot to implement social story intervention was more effective for improving the independency of expressing social abilities for the participants, than the computer screen. Limitations: Future studies should include a bigger sample size, more intervention sessions, and a follow-up session in order to see if the effect persists in time. Conclusions: The preliminary outcomes of this exploratory research provide empirical bases for further investigations regarding the effectiveness of robot assisted therapy in improving social skills for children with autism through future randomized clinical trials."

The therapy is based on a free play between an autistic child, a mobile robot and a therapist. The robot is used as a mediator between the child and the therapist to improve human to human interactions. The aim of our study presented in this paper is an analyzis of the robot-child interactions during predictable play. The child behavior is viewed as a dissipative system that aims at minimising its energy at any time. We propose a model based in Thom's catastrophe theory to represent the changes in the child behavior. A first step in the validation of the model is made with four children. We discuss on the robustness of this approach and the quantification of the clues involved in the modelling."

Most of the humanoid robots are expensive, or come with specific software or method for controlling the robot. This gives limits to what can be done with the robot and the software or method used may not allow expansion of the robot functionalities or possible applications. This paper presents an of system integration example with custom-built graphical toolkit used in controlling a simple toy like robot, the robot (RoboSapien), for a variety of customizable functions and applications. The main focus is on the activities and games that can be used with this platform in order to customize enhance the functionalities of the robot to suit the therapy process for the child under consideration. The mimicking mode of the robot, where the robot mimics the behavior of the user, has been found to be very promising for catching attention, making children involve in an activity, and retain their interest for longer period of time. Several activities have been developed and tested with children having ASD and have shown remarkable improvement in concentration spans, focus, and willingness to follow instructions."

Parents are often not aware of the different nature of children with ASD and attempt to treat him/her the same way as other children. However, that causes more and more isolation of such children from the social interactions around them, resulting in more secluded and people-phobic behaviors. Nevertheless, similar to other children, children with ASD also like to play with toys. This observation has led to the use of toys in a way that mere playful activities could become sources of learning and skill-building, somewhat serving or assisting in the role of a human teacher. Robots have been observed to be fascinating for all children and compensating for a human companion to a certain extent. In this paper, a short study has been presented involving a humanoid robot programmed for a number of teaching and therapeutic behaviors, such as exercises, singing, explaining, and playing with children. Tests were performed on a small group of 15 children with ASD (ages 7–11) using these activities at a local school for children with special needs for a number of weeks. The objective of the study was to quantify the improvement in a number of behavior and learning parameters when children performed the activities with NAO robot present with the teacher, as opposed to the same type of activities performed by the teacher alone. The performance improvement was quantified in terms of the NAO robot activity as independent variable, and following dependent behavioral variables observed from the responses of children: (a) number of trials, (b) activity response time, (c) response type, and (d) behavior retention. Quantified findings from these tests are reported in this paper against average performance values (based on teachers and psychologists’ evaluation). The results of the study have been found to be very encouraging which demonstrates the capability of robotic toys to improve the learning process for children with ASD. The results of this study also encourage the low-cost development and usage of such robotic toy systems for teaching and therapeutic applications that help such children to become better members of society. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."

Some of the most common features related to the behavior of a child with ASD are his/her social isolation, living in their own world, not being physically active, and not willing to learn new things. While the teachers, parents, and all other related care-givers do their best to improve the condition of these kids, it is usually quite an uphill task. However, one remarkable observation that has been reported by several teachers dealing with ASD children is the fact that the same children do get attracted to toys with lights and sounds. Hence, this project targets the development/modifications of such existing toys into appropriate behavior training tools which the care-givers can use as they would desire. Initially, the remote control is in hand of the trainer, but after some time, the child is entrusted with the control of the robotic toy to test for the level of interest. It has been found during the course of this study that children with quite low learning activity got extremely interested in the robot and even advanced to controlling the robot with the PS2 type joystick. It has been observed that the children did show some hesitation in the beginning 5 minutes of the very first sessions of such interaction but were very comfortable afterwards which has been considered as a very strong indicator of the potential of this technique in teaching and rehabilitation of children with ASD or similar brain disorders. © 2013 IEEE."

The work of specialists regarding ASD diagnosis is hard and labor-intensive due to the condition's manifestations are inherently heterogeneous and makes the process more difficult. Besides, the aforementioned complexity may be the main reason for the slow progress in the development of SAR with diagnostic purposes. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive Robot-Assisted Intervention for CwASD showing the conditions in which a Robot-based approach can be useful to assess autism risk factors for an autism diagnosis purpose. The intervention scheme consists of an improved version of a multimodal environment for Robot-based intervention proposed in our previous work. More specifically, we compared the behavior of CwASD with that of children in a control group during a human/robot-mediated intervention while Joint Attention (JA) behaviors are elicited and analyzed. Through statistical data analysis, it was possible to identify that 17 out of 23 children of the CwASD group showed a different behavior pattern related to three characteristics of autism, which suggests that this pattern can be used to identify autism risk factors through Robot-based interventions.

Robot-assisted tools using CRI theories have been of interest in intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (CwASD), elucidating faster and more significant gains from the diagnosis and therapeutic intervention when compared to classical methods. Additionally, using computer vision to analyze child's behaviors and automated video coding to summarize the responses would help clinicians to reduce the delay of ASD diagnosis.

In this way the paper suggests that children appear to interact in a tactile manner quite spontaneously with KASPAR, that the child's tactile actions become modified through exposure to KASPAR and that children with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can demonstrate a marked responsiveness to the behaviours that KASPAR displays in sequences of tactile interaction. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

The children's levels of interaction with and response to different appearances of two types of robots are compared: a small humanoid doll, and a life-sized 'Theatrical Robot' (a mime artist behaving like a robot). The small humanoid robot appeared either as a human-like 'pretty doll' or as a 'robot' with plain features.

Personalized machine learning for robot perception of affect and engagement in autism therapy,2018,Science Robotics,3,19,,"Rudovic, O. and Lee, J. and Dai, M. and Schuller, B. and Picard, R.W.",,"Robots have the potential to facilitate future therapies for children on the autism spectrum. However, existing robots are limited in their ability to automatically perceive and respond to human affect, which is necessary for establishing and maintaining engaging interactions. Their inference challenge is made even harder by the fact that many individuals with autism have atypical and unusually diverse styles of expressing their affective-cognitive states. To tackle the heterogeneity in childrenwith autism, weused the latest advances in deep learning to formulate a personalized machine learning (ML) framework for automatic perception of the children's affective states and engagement during robot-assisted autism therapy. Instead of using the traditional one-size-fits-all ML approach, we personalized our framework to each child using their contextual information (demographics and behavioral assessment scores) and individual characteristics. We evaluated this framework on a multimodal (audio, video, and autonomic physiology) data set of 35 children (ages 3 to 13) with autism, from two cultures (Asia and Europe), and achieved an average agreement (intraclass correlation) of ~60% with human experts in the estimation of affect and engagement, also outperforming nonpersonalized ML solutions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of robot perception of affect and engagement in children with autism and have implications for the design of future autism therapies. © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved;."
Measuring engagement in robotassisted autism Therapy: A crosscultural study,2017,Frontiers Robotics  AI,4,,,"Rudovic, O. and Lee, J. and Mascarell-Maricic, L. and Schuller, B.W. and Picard, R.W.",,"During occupational therapy for children with autism, it is often necessary to elicit and maintain engagement for the children to benefit from the session. Recently, social robots have been used for this; however, existing robots lack the ability to autonomously recognize the children's level of engagement, which is necessary when choosing an optimal interaction strategy. Progress in automated engagement reading has been impeded in part due to a lack of studies on child-robot engagement in autism therapy. While it is well known that there are large individual differences in autism, little is known about how these vary across cultures. To this end, we analyzed the engagement of children (age 3-13) from two different cultural backgrounds: Asia (Japan, n = 17) and Eastern Europe (Serbia, n = 19). The children participated in a 25 min therapy session during which we studied the relationship between the children's behavioral engagement (task-driven) and different facets of affective engagement (valence and arousal). Although our results indicate that there are statistically significant differences in engagement displays in the two groups, it is difficult to make any causal claims about these differences due to the large variation in age and behavioral severity of the children in the study. However, our exploratory analysis reveals important associations between target engagement and perceived levels of valence and arousal, indicating that these can be used as a proxy for the children's engagement during the therapy. We provide suggestions on how this can be leveraged to optimize social robots for autism therapy, while taking into account cultural differences. © 2017 Rudovic, Lee, Mascarell-Maricic, Schuller and Picard."

In this paper, we investigate the performance of deep learning models in the task of automated engagement estimation from face images of children with autism. Specifically, we use the video data of 30 children with different cultural backgrounds (Asia vs. Europe) recorded during a single session of a robot-assisted autism therapy. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed deep architectures for the target task, including within- and across-culture evaluations, as well as when using the child-independent and child-dependent settings. We also introduce a novel deep learning model, named CultureNet, which efficiently leverages the multi-cultural data when performing the adaptation of the proposed deep architecture to the target culture and child. We show that due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the image data of children with autism, the child-independent models lead to overall poor estimation of target engagement levels. On the other hand, when a small amount of data of target children is used to enhance the model learning, the estimation performance on the held-out data from those children increases significantly.

This tutoring system featured a virtual teacher instructing sight words, and included a humanoid robot emulating a peer. The authors used a multiple-probe design across word sets to evaluate the effects of the instructional package on the explicit acquisition and vicarious learning of sight words instructed to three children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the robot peer. Results indicated that participants acquired, maintained, and generalized 100% of the words explicitly instructed to them, made fewer errors while learning the words common between them and the robot peer, and vicariously learned 94% of the words solely instructed to the robot."

The program focuses on linking voice to gestures, and checks the emotional effects of this linkage. Rob’Autism is divided into 20 sessions of 1 h each, alternating preparatory sessions and robotics sessions. During the preparatory sessions, the subjects register their voices reading a story. During the robotics sessions, the subjects program the robot gestures according to the registered voices. In this program, the robots are used as an extension, and not as a companion as traditionally performed in other research programs. Consequently, the subjects immediately use it for their communication with others, showing consequent improvements of their communication skills, inside and outside the sessions, in a very short time. The program has also proven to length in time, as 6 months after its end, its effects on the subjects can still be observed.

Development of an ABA autism intervention delivered by a humanoid robot,2016,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9979,,551-560,"Salvador, M. and Marsh, A.S. and Gutierrez, A. and Mahoor, M.H.",,"Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) techniques are widely used and accepted by the Autism research community as an effective Autism therapy method. ABA techniques have been recently introduced to use with Socially Assistive robots (SAR) to deliver Autism therapy. Nonetheless, little research has been published to investigate the use of robot-based ABA in teaching socio-emotional skills for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This paper presents the development of an ABA-based autonomous therapy system delivered by a humanoid robot, the Zeno R-50. Specifically, an intervention methodology with a prompt and an ABA reinforcement protocol to target skills associated with facial and situational emotion recognition and understanding are presented. Eleven children diagnosed with Autism were recruited to participate in the pre-pilot study screening. Initial results are investigated to discover the children’s preferred reinforcers and also to find ways of improving the therapy system before proceeding through full study groups. Results demonstrate the successful detection of reinforcers and show there is correlation between reinforcer preference and age. Results on two children who have completed interventions are presented and improvements to the protocol are discussed to contribute to the understanding of SAR in teaching socio-emotional skills to children diagnosed with ASD. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016."

Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems."
CopyRobot: Interactive Mirroring Robotics Game for ASD Children,2020,IFMBE Proceedings,76,,2014-2027,"Santos, L. and Geminiani, A. and Olivieri, I. and Santos-Victor, J. and Pedrocchi, A.",,"The family of disorders commonly known as autism is characterized by a deficit in social interaction and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviours, activities and interests. Motor disturbances are not part of the diagnosis of the children with autism but some studies have estimated that between 80 and 90% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) demonstrate some degree of motor impairments. Several therapies have been used for the improvement of motor skills, always leading to behavioural improvements as side-effects, demonstrating the importance of motor interaction and stimulation for the case of autism. Recent studies have shown that motor, imitation and social abilities are all related in people with autism. In this work, a humanoid robot is used to create a therapy that unites all these areas. The system involves a robot (NAO), a Kinect camera and Personal Computer, with the goal of facilitating the interaction between therapist and a child with ASD during a physical therapy session. To improve the imitation abilities of the child, the robot was programmed to mirror both the child and the therapist movements. After testing different tracking methodologies, the Kinect sensor was selected as the best compromise of quality and cost. Two protocols were developed, depending on who plays the role of the main actor. In the first protocol, the robot is the master and leads the interaction. It decides the exercise to execute and gives feedback to both the therapist and the child. In the second protocol, the choice of the exercise sequence is the therapist’s responsibility. To promote interaction further during clinical tests, the protocol was changed to include gesture imitation. For the robot master protocol, the space theme was chosen. For the therapist master protocol, the theme of sports, that was already performed by the children in the usual therapy, was adopted. The system was tested in realistic conditions with two different autistic children. The reaction was different in each case but it demonstrated the importance of these imitation games in the treatment of this disease. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Our study focused on a 1-month, home-based intervention for increasing social communication skills of 12 children with ASD between 6 and 12 years old using an autonomous social robot. The children engaged in a triadic interaction with a caregiver and the robot for 30 min every day to complete activities on emotional storytelling, perspective-taking, and sequencing. The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child's past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires. Caregivers reported less prompting over time and overall increased communication. © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved."
Differences in Spontaneous Interactions of Autistic Children in an Interaction With an Adult and Humanoid Robot,2020,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,7,,,"Schadenberg, B.R. and Reidsma, D. and Heylen, D.K.J. and Evers, V.",,"Robots are promising tools for promoting engagement of autistic children in interventions and thereby increasing the amount of learning opportunities. However, designing deliberate robot behavior aimed at engaging autistic children remains challenging. Our current understanding of what interactions with a robot, or facilitated by a robot, are particularly motivating to autistic children is limited to qualitative reports with small sample sizes. Translating insights from these reports to design is difficult due to the large individual differences among autistic children in their needs, interests, and abilities. To address these issues, we conducted a descriptive study and report on an analysis of how 31 autistic children spontaneously interacted with a humanoid robot and an adult within the context of a robot-assisted intervention, as well as which individual characteristics were associated with the observed interactions. For this analysis, we used video recordings of autistic children engaged in a robot-assisted intervention that were recorded as part of the DE-ENIGMA database. The results showed that the autistic children frequently engaged in exploratory and functional interactions with the robot spontaneously, as well as in interactions with the adult that were elicited by the robot. In particular, we observed autistic children frequently initiating interactions aimed at making the robot do a certain action. Autistic children with stronger language ability, social functioning, and fewer autism spectrum-related symptoms, initiated more functional interactions with the robot and more robot-elicited interactions with the adult. We conclude that the children's individual characteristics, in particular the child's language ability, can be indicative of which types of interaction they are more likely to find interesting. Taking these into account for the design of deliberate robot behavior, coupled with providing more autonomy over the robot's behavior to the autistic children, appears promising for promoting engagement and facilitating more learning opportunities. © Copyright © 2020 Schadenberg, Reidsma, Heylen and Evers."
Child–robot interaction across cultures: How does playing a game with a social robot compare to playing a game alone or with a friend?,2014,Computers in Human Behavior,40,,86-100,"Shahid, Suleman and Krahmer, Emiel and Swerts, Marc",,"The present study investigates how children from two different cultural backgrounds (Pakistani, Dutch) and two different age groups (8 and 12year olds) experience interacting with a social robot (iCat) during collaborative game play. We propose a new method to evaluate children’s interaction with such a robot, by asking whether playing a game with a state-of-the-art social robot like the iCat is more similar to playing this game alone or with a friend. A combination of self-report scores, perception test results and behavioral analyses indicate that child–robot interaction in game playing situations is highly appreciated by children, although more by Pakistani and younger children than by Dutch and older children. Results also suggest that children enjoyed playing with the robot more than playing alone, but enjoyed playing with a friend even more. In a similar vein, we found that children were more expressive in their non-verbal behavior when playing with the robot than when they were playing alone, but less expressive than when playing with a friend. Our results not only stress the importance of using new benchmarks for evaluating child–robot interaction but also highlight the significance of cultural differences for the design of social robots."

A. and Mohamed, S.",CENTRE ADVANCED RESEARCH ENERGY-CARE,"Recent advances show that robots have unlimited potential to help the disabled community by providing physical support, social engagement and even co-therapy in collaboration with another human. For children with autism, a robot in human shape might be able to help them to learn better and encourage social-communication skills. To prove this, the key initial step is to explore the initial response of children with autism when they interact with a humanoid robot in an experimental setting. We hypothesize that a robot's presence coupled with specific interplay shall attract the children's attention to engage in robot-based interaction. The initial responses will be utilized to seek association between responses to the robot with the children's intelligence level. Twelve autistic children with IQs between 44 and 107 were exposed to different interactions. Behavior evaluation showed that in the presence of the robot, lower autistic traits were recorded in the subscale of stereotyped behavior and communication. Also, children with IQs higher than 80 were more receptive to robot-based single exposure."

We also seek the association between responses to the robot with the children's intelligence level. Results with 12 children were analyzed to acquire relationship between initial responses and the children's IQ scores. Analysis indicates that the presence of the robot had significantly reduced the scores of autistic traits in the subscale of stereotyped behavior and communication.

A Qualitative method to analyze response in robotic intervention for children with autism,2013,Proceedings - IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication,,,324-325,"Shamsuddin, S. and Yussof, H. and Hanapiah, F.A. and Mohamed, S.",,This paper presents a method to carry out qualitative analysis when evaluating the interaction between child and robot in autism intervention. The technique consists of 24-items of behavioral assessment which was referenced to the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (GARS-2). GARS-2 is a screening instrument used to identify and diagnose autism. Preliminary results from a pilot study show that this method had allowed qualitative observation to be carried out to compare the behavior of autistic children with and without the presence of a robot. The feasibility of this technique will be further justified through future wide-spread studies involving a larger number of children spanning across the whole spectrum of autism. © 2013 IEEE.
Humanoid robot NAO interacting with autistic children of moderately impaired intelligence to augment communication skills,2012,Procedia Engineering,41,,1533-1538,"Shamsuddin, S. and Yussof, H. and Ismail, L.I. and Mohamed, S. and Hanapiah, F.A. and Zahari, N.I.",,"This report presents the findings from our pilot study on the initial behavior of autistic children of moderately impaired intelligence when exposed to simple human-robot interaction (HRI) modules executed by a humanoid robot NAO. All 5 children have been specifically assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and their diagnosis is classified as autistic disorder. We hypothesize that NAOs human-like appearance, its capability to blink its eyes, speak and play music; coupled with the simplicity of the HRI modules will be able to entice the childrens interest to engage in communication. Hence, this would significantly reduce the childrens autisticcharacteristics in communication behavior compared to the usual class setting. In this study, the principal result shows that 4 out of the 5 children exhibited a decrease of autistic behavior (in communication subscale) when the robot is executing HRI modules during the single session of child-robot interaction. This promising outcome indicates that the NAO robot were able to attract the childrens attention, keep each child engaged with the robot during interaction and hence give positive impact to the childrens communication behavior. Relating this to the childrens FSIQ, it can be deducted that autistic children with FSIQ of moderately impaired (from 40-54) are receptive to robotbased intervention. This is again showed by the lower autistic traits observed during the HRI modules compared to in-class setting. Overall, this research suggests that autistic children of moderately impaired intelligence show good response to robot-based intervention. This finding is crucial to form a solid foundation and proof on the positive utilization of the humanoid robot NAO for the children affected by autism. © 2012 The Authors."

Autism is a developmental disability normally detected within the first 3 years of life, characterized by the differing degrees of impairments in stereotyped behavior, social interaction and communication. This paper highlights our findings in a pilot study where children with autism were exposed to a humanoid robot. The simple modules of interaction were designed based on the human-robot interaction (HRI) approach. Six children who participated were identified with lower IQ classification. Child-robot interaction session and the children's interaction behavior in class (without robot) were recorded. A behavior score sheet referenced to GARS-2 was used to evaluate the videos in both set-ups. Initial responses of the children were analyzed specifically in the deficit area of stereotyped behavior. Overall results show that 5 out of the 6 children responded well in child-robot interaction. Comparison with in-class interaction portrays reduced percentage in stereotyped behavior during the child-robot interaction. However, strong proof to link the children's responses with their IQ levels need to be supported with larger samples of children in the future. © 2013 IEEE."
Initial Response in HRI- a Case Study on Evaluation of Child with Autism Spectrum Disorders Interacting with a Humanoid Robot NAO,2012,International Symposium on Robotics and Intelligent Sensors 2012 (IRIS 2012),41,,1448-1455,"Shamsuddin, Syamimi and Yussof, Hanafiah and Ismail, Luthffi Idzhar and Mohamed, Salina and Hanapiah, Fazah Akhtar and Zahari, Nur Ismarrubie",,"The evolution of human-robot interaction (HRI) is now expanding its wings to aid children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in areas of socialization, communication and playful behavior through robot-based intervention. Herein we present our holistic, long-standing goal to contribute to the lives of children with ASD; who suffer a lifelong developmental disability. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on a case study in our pilot experiment where a child with ASD is exposed to the humanoid robot NAO in order to gauge his initial response and behavior in the presence of a robot. NAO robot is the chosen robotic agent as it is a commercially available humanoid with simpler in appearance compared to real humans, thus appears more approachable to children with ASD. The pilot procedures involve the robot executing basic, simple components of interaction through a series of 5 different modules. In this study, the principal results show that the basic HRI carried out by the robot is able to suppress the child's autistic behavior during the child-robot interaction. Also, more eye contact is observed between the child and robot compared to the child with his teacher during regular class session. Relating this to the child's IQ which falls in the moderate category, it is suggested that children with ASD in the same IQ group will be receptive to robot-based intervention even in the first interaction session. Hence, it can be concluded that the humanoid robot NAO has potential to serve as a platform to support and initiate interaction in children with ASD."

Robots can achieve high levels of effectiveness in interacting with children with autism. This paper presents robots that play several important roles and benefits in the interaction of children with autism. In the absence of dialogue corpus, we collected and integrated conversation data for children with autism.

In a field study, individuals with autism spectrum disorder, who often face obstacles in social interaction, were provided daily-life-guidance by a robot tele-operated by their caregiver. In cases in which the robot was operated remotely or from the same room, subjects were able to disclose concerns to the robot that they had not previously disclosed to their caregiver. Furthermore, under the latter case the improved communicability was maintained through subsequent conversation with the operator. In a separate laboratory experiment involving participants not judged to be on the autism spectrum, it was observed that the participants were silent longer during conversation via a robot than in face-to-face conversation. The enhanced length of silence in the first setting can be considered to be an index for good counseling of a subject. Furthermore, the enhanced length of silence was maintained in subsequent face-to-face conversation with a robot operator in the same room, which appears to be consistent with the results of the field experiment. The findings encourage future applications in therapeutic conversation approaches such as counseling for providing clients with environments that facilitate the disclosure of concerns. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V."

During the trials, they also showed changes in their attitudes toward their teachers and friends; this implies that individuals with ASD could use their experience of communication with a robot for communication with a human.

We find that the children can be divided into two groups depending on their reaction to the robot; for some children, the robot was an engaging object that elicited social behavior by providing novel and appealing sensory experiences (primarily bubble-blowing), while for other children, the robot was an agent and elicited social behavior through agent-like actions such as autonomous movement. We found that the first group had small differences between robot conditions and vocalized most with the bubble-blowing toy, while the second group vocalized most with the humanoid robots and looked less at the humanoid portion of the robot with reduced behavioral agency."

Accordingly, the aim of this research was to evaluate the fitness of robot-assisted mental health interventions among individuals with ID and to assess its impact on the users and their caregivers. Firstly, the fitness of robot-assisted mental health interventions was studied through interviews conducted with seven expert psychologists and professional caregivers working daily with individuals with ID. The interviews helped to identify key aspects of a beneficial robot-assisted mental health intervention. Secondly, a case study of robot interactions among six individuals with ID was performed using a NAO robot in different categories of interaction identified by experts. The case study trials were assessed using a questionnaire and results reported positive effects of such interventions on the users, mainly an increase in the engagement. The results also highlight the need for the development of an interactive and adaptive robot-assisted solution for the benefit of the users. Finally, a cognitive rehabilitation activity with and without the robot was conducted in order to assess the impact of the interventions on the caregivers. Thus, thirty individuals with ID and five caregivers participated in multi-center trials which allowed a multidimensional evaluation of the caregiver's workload. The results confirmed a significant reduction in caregivers burden and raise a concern about the need for a specific training of the caregivers to take maximum advantage of SAR empowered cognitive rehabilitation. This work provides valuable insights for the development of robot-assisted interventions for cognitive rehabilitation of people with ID."

Although encouraging results suggest that robots can be beneficial, there has been minimal progress in integrating this technology as formal tools to supplement therapy and education. A significant reason behind this is that the benefits of using robots have been demonstrated primarily in short-term case studies, with very few demonstrations over large samples. This study explores the impact of a prolonged exposure to socially-assistive robots in an education context with secondary students with intellectual disabilities and autism.

Social stories in robot-assisted therapy for children with ASD,2016,Supporting the Education of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,,,225-244,"Silvera-Tawil, D. and Strnadová, I. and Cumming, T.M.",,"Mobile technology devices are commonly used as assistive technology to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in gaining skills in interpersonal communication. While considered generally safe and effective, there are concerns that a child that is taught to communicate through interactive technologies may become dependent on the virtual world and its rewards, while interpersonal skills are sacrificed or not generalized to real world settings (Bauminger-Zviely, Eden, Zancanaro, Weiss, & Gal, 2013). This chapter theorizes that the anthropomorphic embodiment of humanoid robots may provide a compromise between the real and the virtual worlds. The authors suggest that a humanoid robot can use social stories within an Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) framework to support the acquisition of social interaction skills of children with ASD. The objective of this chapter is to contribute to the current literature by providing a description of this intervention and make suggestions for its implementation using a case study approach. © 2017 by IGI Global.

Is the social robot probo an added value for social story intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders?,2012,HRI'12 - Proceedings of the 7th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,,,235-236,"Simut, R. and Pop, C. and Saldien, J. and Rusu, A. and Pintea, S. and V and erfaeillie, J. and David, D. and V and erborght, B.",,"In this paper, we describe the first results of using the robot Probo as a facilitator in Social Story Intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Four preschoolers diagnosed with ASD participated in this research. For each of them, a specific social skill deficit was identified, like sharing toys, saying Thank you, saying Hello, and an individualized Social Story was developed. The stories were told by both the therapist and the robot in different intervention phases. Afterwards an experimental task was created where the child needed to exercise the ability targeted by the story. The results of this study showed that the participant needed a decreased level of prompt to perform the targeted behavior, when the story was told by the robot compared to the intervention with the human storyteller. Therefore, this preliminary study created great expectancies about the potential of Robot Assisted Therapy as an added value for ASD interventions. © 2012 Authors."

Robot dramas may improve joint attention of Chinese-speaking low-functioning children with autism: stepped wedge trials,2020,Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology,,,,"So, W.-C. and Cheng, C.-H. and Law, W.-W. and Wong, T. and Lee, C. and Kwok, F.-Y. and Lee, S.-H. and Lam, K.-Y.",,"Introduction: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially those with low cognitive functioning, have deficits in joint attention. Previous research has found that these children are interested in engaging with social robots. Purpose: In the present study, we designed a robot drama intervention for promoting responses to joint attention abilities (RJA) of children with low-functioning autism (IQs < 70). Materials and methods: Using a stepped wedge design, Chinese-speaking children aged six to eight were randomly assigned to three tiers (N = 18). Children of all three tiers had comparable autism severity, language and cognitive function, and joint attention abilities. Tier 1 first received intervention, followed by Tiers 2 and 3. They watched six dramas in which social robots demonstrated RJA behaviours. Results: The RJA of children of all tiers improved after intervention and such improvement was maintained over time. Despite initiation of joint attention (IJA) not being explicitly taught, IJA of all children was found to improve after intervention. Conclusions: It was, therefore, concluded that a robot drama could enhance the joint attention of children with low-functioning ASD.Implications for rehabilitation In comparison to typically developing children, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially those with low cognitive functioning, have deficits in joint attention. Robot-based drama intervention program was developed to promote responses to joint attention (RJA) abilities of children with low-functioning autism (IQs < 70). Modelling RJA in robot dramas can promote RJA abilities in these children. An improvement in RJA also yielded an increase in the initiation of joint attention (IJA) abilities. Children with low-functioning autism might be able to extract the initiation of joint attention skills from the drama, even though these behaviours were not explicitly taught. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Robot-based intervention may reduce delay in the production of intransitive gestures in Chinese-speaking preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder,2018,Molecular Autism,9,1,,"So, W.-C. and Wong, M.K.-Y. and Lam, W.-Y. and Cheng, C.-H. and Yang, J.-H. and Huang, Y. and Ng, P. and Wong, W.-L. and Ho, C.-L. and Yeung, K.-L. and Lee, C.-C.",,"Background: Past studies have shown that robot-based intervention was effective in improving gestural use in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The present study examined whether children with ASD could catch up to the level of gestural production found in age-matched children with typical development and whether they showed an increase in verbal imitation after the completion of robot-based training. We also explored the cognitive and motor skills associated with gestural learning. Methods: Children with ASD were randomly assigned to two groups. Four- to 6-year-old children with ASD in the intervention group (N = 15) received four 30-min robot-based gestural training sessions. In each session, a social robot, NAO, narrated five stories and gestured (e.g., both hands clapping for an awesome expression). Children with ASD were told to imitate the gestures during training. Age-matched children with ASD in the wait-list control group (N = 15) and age-matched children with typical development (N = 15) received the gestural training after the completion of research. Standardized pretests and posttests (both immediate and delayed) were administered to assess the accuracy and appropriateness of gestural production in both training and novel stories. Children's language and communication abilities, gestural recognition skills, fine motor proficiencies, and attention skills were also examined. Results: Children with ASD in the intervention condition were more likely to produce accurate or appropriate intransitive gestures in training and novel stories than those in the wait-list control. The positive learning outcomes were maintained in the delayed posttests. The level of gestural production accuracy in children with ASD in the delayed posttest of novel stories was comparable to that in children with typical development, suggesting that children with ASD could catch up to the level of gestural production found in children with typical development. Children with ASD in the intervention condition were also more likely to produce verbal markers while gesturing than those in the wait-list control. Gestural recognition skills were found to significantly predict the learning of gestural production accuracy in the children with ASD, with such relation partially mediated via spontaneous imitation. Conclusions: Robot-based intervention may reduce the gestural delay in children with ASD in their early childhood. © 2018 The Author(s)."

The main objective of the study is to promote the interaction and communication with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by using robots. Different approaches have been followed by the researchers enrolled in this project. Some studies are focused on using Lego robots to teach social and academic skills to children with ASD; other studies are dedicated to the detection of stereotyped movements in children with ASD using two different methods: the Kinect sensor and accelerometers. Recent work is related to the use of a humanoid robot that allows facial expressions to facilitate the emotion recognition and teaching facial expressions.

The proposed RSE consisted of two parrot-like robots and a robotic ball to enable us to teach children with autism both social and nonsocial skills. The results on data from six high functioning children with autism show that the children learned an unknown skill, such as how to play with the robotic ball, through observing the robots. Furthermore, the results show that, despite limited capabilities of our robots for social interaction (i.e., voice-based social interaction), the children could understand the social characteristics, such as turn taking of the designed RSE. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The first manuscript reported intervention effects on the spontaneous and responsive social attention skills of children. In this manuscript, we report intervention effects on the spontaneous and responsive verbal communication skills of children. Communication skills were assessed within a standardized test of responsive communication during the pretest and posttest as well as using training-specific measures of social verbalization during early, mid, and late training sessions. The rhythm and comparison groups improved on the standardized test in the posttest compared to the pretest. The rhythm and robot groups increased levels of social verbalization across training sessions. Movement-based and stationary contexts afforded different types and amounts of communication in children with ASD. Overall, movement-based interventions are a promising tool to enhance verbal and non-verbal communication skills in children with ASD."

We coded for frequencies of sensory, negative, and stereotyped behaviors and the duration of positive, negative, and interested affective states in children during early, mid, and late training sessions. In terms of repetitive behaviors, in the early session, the rhythm and robot groups engaged in greater negative behaviors, whereas the comparison group engaged in greater sensory behaviors. With training, the rhythm group reduced negative behaviors whereas there were no training-related changes in the other groups. In terms of affective states, the rhythm and robot groups showed greater negative affect, whereas the comparison group demonstrated greater interested affect across all sessions. With training, the rhythm group showed a reduction in negative affect and an increase in interested affect whereas the robot group showed a reduction in positive affect.

These changes were evaluated with a series of eleven case studies where teacher-pupil dyads were observed during four planned video recorded sessions. Engagement was rated in a classroom setting and during the last session with the robot. Video recordings were analysed for duration of engagement and teacher assistance and number of goals achieved.

Staff and volunteers at the nursery were trained in using Kaspar and were using it in their day-to-day activities in the nursery. Our study combines an ""in the wild""approach with a rigorous approach of collecting and including users' feedback during an iterative evaluation and design cycle of the robot. This article focuses on the design of the study and the results from several interviews with the robot's users. We also show results from the children's developmental assessments by the teachers prior to and after the study. Results suggest a marked beneficial effect for the children from interacting with Kaspar. We highlight the challenges of transferring experimental technologies like Kaspar from a research setting into everyday practice in general and making it part of the day-to-day running of a nursery school in particular. Feedback from users led subsequently to many changes being made to Kaspar's hardware and software. This type of invaluable feedback can only be gained in such long-term field studies. © 2020 Dag Sverre Syrdal et al., published by De Gruyter 2020."

The results indicated that all participants' autism severity decreased after the course of the program. Improvement in social skills, social participation/avoidance, and detrimental social behaviors were also observed in the participants with high-functioning autism with close to being large Cohen's d effect sizes. Moreover, based on the video coders' observations the joint attention, gaze scores toward the robot, and verbal communications of the paired-groups increased significantly over the treatment time (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, noticeable improvements were seen in social/cognitive skills of all four participants as well as in the positive effect of this program on fine motor imitation skills of two subjects after the interventions. The progress reported from this preliminary exploratory study confirmed the potential benefits of using social robots and intelligent technologies as facilitators in music-teaching and cognitive-rehabilitation.

A Close Look at the Imitation Performance of Children with Autism and Typically Developing Children Using a Robotic System,2020,International Journal of Social Robotics,,,,"Taheri, A. and Meghdari, A. and Mahoor, M.H.",,"Deficit in imitation skills is one of the core symptoms of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, we have tried to look closer at the body gesture imitation performance of 20 participants with autism, i.e. ASD group, and 20 typically developing subjects, i.e. TD group, in a set of robot-child and human-child gross imitation tasks. The results of manual scoring by two specialists indicated that while the TD group showed a significantly better imitation performance than the ASD group during the tasks, both ASD and TD groups performed better in the human-child mode than the robot-child mode in our experimental setup. Next, to introduce an automated imitation assessment system, we present different mathematical models of the children’s imitation performance using some State-Image based algorithms including Acceptable Bound, Mahalanobis Distance, and Signals’ Cross-Correlations as well as Hidden Markov Models based on the time-dependent kinematics data of the participants’ joints. Among the different studied models, we observed that the “State-Image Acceptable Bound method with position, velocity, and acceleration features” is the best one. This method has a mean Pearson correlation of ~ 45%, which is fairly comparable to the related works (out of autism field) in assessing the quality of dynamic actions. Finally, for a treatment application of using artificial intelligence algorithms in automated evaluation of children’s behaviors as an unbiased and quantifiable measurement in HRI, we propose a reciprocal gross imitation human–robot interaction platform with the potential to aid in the cognitive rehabilitation of children with autism. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

Moreover, the children showed some improvement in imitation, joint attention, and social skills from the Pre-Test to Post-Test. In addition, regarding music education, we indicated that while the children could not pass a test on the music notes or reading music phrases items because of their cognitive deficits, they showed acceptable improvements (with a large Cohen’s d effect size) in the Stambak Rhythm Reproduction Test, which means that some rhythm learning occurred for the LF participants. In addition, we indicated that parenting stress levels decreased during the program.

Portable Robotic Modular Kit for Teaching Gestures in Children with ASD,2021,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,763,,210-225,"Tobar, J. and Delgado, J. and Muñoz, B. and Bacca, B. and Caicedo, E.",,"Technological advancement in recent years has allowed effective development in various fields, the link between technology and education is undoubtedly one of them. The health emergency that has arisen in recent months worldwide is a call for innovation to continue with learning processes that adapt to new study modalities. That is why this work proposes the development of a portable robotic modular kit for teaching gestures in children with autism spectrum disorder. The aim is to contribute to the development of non-verbal communication. The portable robotic modular kit consists of an Android application, a robot with 20 interchangeable parts and one container box to transport the robotic kit. The Android application has 3 working modes. Two of them are for working without the robot and the main working mode is the one that controls the robot. The validation of the tool was carried out by experts in the field of teaching to children with ASD. 65.57% of the people evaluated considered that the system can contribute to the teaching of gestures to autistic children and 70.49% of people considered that the tool can be used in children without disorder. Finally, the tool was presented in 5 therapy sessions in children with ASD within the Neuropsychological Rehabilitation Center CERENI. The results obtained are quite encouraging. We obtained a satisfaction of 100% in children with autism grade 1, while in children with autism grade 2 and 3 we obtained a satisfaction of 50% on the scale proposed with an increasing trend. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Specifically, arm and torso motions of the robot follow closely those of the human, this mimicking behavior, can be used for clinical treatment and diagnosis during robot therapy of subjects suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In this paper, we describe algorithms and results of implementing simple position control schemes on Zeno via visual feedback from Kinect data. The behavior can be used by therapists to achieve desired poses of the robot that may be beneficial to children with ASD by enhancing their motor skills as well as social interaction. Results show that in this case, simple actuators, sensors and control schemes can generate smooth and responsive robot trajectories."

Treatments rely on teaching social skills and in such therapies robotics may offer aid. This work is a pilot study, which aims to show the development and usage of a ludic mobile robot for stimulating social skills in ASD children. Methods: A mobile robot with a special costume and a monitor to display multimedia contents was designed to interact with ASD children. A mediator controls the robot’s movements in a room prepared for interactive sessions. Sessions are recorded to assess the following social skills: eye gazing, touching the robot and imitating the mediator. The interaction is evaluated using the Goal Attainment Scale and Likert scale. Ten children were evaluated (50% with ASD), using as inclusion criteria children with age 7-8, without use of medication, and without tendency to aggression or stereotyped movements. Results: It was observed that the ASD group touched the robot about twice more in average than the control group (CG). They also looked away and imitated the mediator in a quite similar way as the CG, and showed extra social skills (verbal and non-verbal communication). These results are considered an advance in terms of improvement of social skills in ASD children. Conclusions: Our studies indicate that the robot stimulated social skills in 4/5 of the ASD children, which shows that its concepts are useful to improve socialization and quality of life. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

Since robots potentially appeal to children with ASD and may contribute to their motivation for social interaction, this exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted comparing PRT (PRT and robot-assisted PRT) with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Seventy-three children (PRT: n = 25; PRT + robot: n = 25; TAU: n = 23) with ASD, aged 3–8 years were assessed at baseline, after 10 and 20 weeks of intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. There were no significant group differences on parent- and teacher-rated general social-communicative skills and blindly rated global functioning directly after treatment. However, at follow-up largest gains were observed in robot-assisted PRT compared to other groups.

However, there is no clarity on the impact of the interaction quality between a child with ASD and a robot on the effectiveness of the therapy. Previous research showed that the use of a robot in Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) could be an effective treatment component in diminishing ASD-related symptoms. Further analyzing the data from a randomized controlled trial of PRT treatment, we looked at the long-term effects of child-robot game interactions to see whether the interaction quality changes over time. The attention and the engagement of six children were measured through the observation of non-verbal behavior at three different stages in the treatment that took 20 sessions per child. The gaze and arm/hand behavior of the participants towards the robot, the game, and other present humans were observed. The analysis showed no significant decrease in the attention and the engagement of the children towards the robot and the game. However, the attention and engagement toward the parents of the children increased. We conclude that the main result of sustained attention and engagement with the robot is due to the personalization of the games to meet the specific needs of this user group. These specific needs are met through inclusion of variability to the level of development and personal choice of each participating child. We see the additional finding of increased attention towards the parents as especially positive since the children are expected to improve in human-human interaction as a result of this treatment."

We investigated in an exploratory study whether a robot’s intonation (monotonous vs. normal) and bodily appearance (mechanical vs. humanized) influence the treatment outcomes of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) sessions for children with ASD. The children (age range 4–8 years) played puzzle games with a robot which required communication with the robot. The treatment outcomes were measured in terms of both task performance and affective states. We have found that intonation and bodily appearance have an effect on children’s affective states but not on task performance. Specifically, humanized bodily appearance leads to more positive affective states in general and a higher degree of interest in the interaction than mechanical bodily appearance. Congruence between bodily appearance and intonation triggers a higher degree of happiness in children with ASD than incongruence between these two factors. © 2017, The Author(s)."

This study explores the efficacy of the innovative therapeutic robot seal Paro on alertness and mood in adults with moderate to severe ID. Method: Five N = 1 studies were performed in adults (59–70 years) with moderate to severe ID. During a control phase of four weeks, participants could interact with a plush seal, which was replaced by the robot seal Paro during an equally long treatment phase. Results: In one participant, alertness and mood, as rated by supervisors, improved during the treatment phase as compared to the baseline phase. The other four participants did not improve on either of the outcome measures. Conclusion: We conclude that robot-based AAT does not have clear beneficial effects on alertness and mood in adults with moderate to severe ID, but that positive interactions with the robot seal could be of therapeutic value in itself. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2017 Eline Wagemaker, Tycho J.

A Pilot Study with a Novel Setup for Collaborative Play of the Humanoid Robot KASPAR with Children with Autism,2014,International Journal of Social Robotics,6,1,45-65,"Wainer, J. and Dautenhahn, K. and Robins, B. and Amirabdollahian, F.",,"This article describes a pilot study in which a novel experimental setup, involving an autonomous humanoid robot, KASPAR, participating in a collaborative, dyadic video game, was implemented and tested with children with autism, all of whom had impairments in playing socially and communicating with others. The children alternated between playing the collaborative video game with a neurotypical adult and playing the same game with the humanoid robot, being exposed to each condition twice. The equipment and experimental setup were designed to observe whether the children would engage in more collaborative behaviours while playing the video game and interacting with the adult than performing the same activities with the humanoid robot. The article describes the development of the experimental setup and its first evaluation in a small-scale exploratory pilot study. The purpose of the study was to gain experience with the operational limits of the robot as well as the dyadic video game, to determine what changes should be made to the systems, and to gain experience with analyzing the data from this study in order to conduct a more extensive evaluation in the future. Based on our observations of the childrens' experiences in playing the cooperative game, we determined that while the children enjoyed both playing the game and interacting with the robot, the game should be made simpler to play as well as more explicitly collaborative in its mechanics. Also, the robot should be more explicit in its speech as well as more structured in its interactions. Results show that the children found the activity to be more entertaining, appeared more engaged in playing, and displayed better collaborative behaviours with their partners (For the purposes of this article, 'partner' refers to the human/robotic agent which interacts with the children with autism. We are not using the term's other meanings that refer to specific relationships or emotional involvement between two individuals.) in the second sessions of playing with human adults than during their first sessions. One way of explaining these findings is that the children's intermediary play session with the humanoid robot impacted their subsequent play session with the human adult. However, another longer and more thorough study would have to be conducted in order to better re-interpret these findings. Furthermore, although the children with autism were more interested in and entertained by the robotic partner, the children showed more examples of collaborative play and cooperation while playing with the human adult. © 2013 The Author(s)."

The class took place once a week over several months and used many different measures to assess the children's collaborative behaviours. Detailed analysis of behavioural data is presented, and despite the small sample size, our findings suggest that the number of potentially collaborative behaviours the children displayed during a class is more strongly related to the amount of enjoyment the children derived from the classes than to the number of classes in which the children participated. Parallel-run, free-form drawing sessions conducted before certain classes gave some indication that these behavioural changes partly generalized to a different context.

Our proof-of-concept 10-week, long term study demonstrates how a humanoid robot can be used to foster and support collaborative play among children with autism. In this work, KASPAR operates fully autonomously, and uses information on the state of the game and behavior of the children to engage, motivate, encourage, and advise pairs of children playing an imitation game. Results are presented from a first evaluation study which examined whether having pairs of children with autism play an imitative, collaborative game with a humanoid robot affected the way these children would play the same game without the robot. Our initial evaluation involved six children with autism who each participated in 23 controlled play sessions both with and without the robot, using a specially designed imitation-based collaborative game. In total 78 play sessions were run. Detailed observational analyses of the children's behaviors indicated that different pairs of children with autism showed improved social behaviors in playing with each other after they played as pairs with the robot KASPAR compared to before they did so. These results are encouraging and provide a proof-of-concept of using an autonomously operating robot to encourage collaborative skills among children with autism. © 2014 IEEE."
Attention shifting during child—robot interaction: a preliminary clinical study for children with autism spectrum disorder,2019,Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering,20,3,374-387,"Wan, G.-B. and Deng, F.-H. and Jiang, Z.-J. and Lin, S.-Z. and Zhao, C.-L. and Liu, B.-X. and Chen, G. and Chen, S.-H. and Cai, X.-H. and Wang, H.-B. and Li, L.-P. and Yan, T. and Zhang, J.-M.",,"There is an increasing need to introduce socially interactive robots as a means of assistance in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatment and rehabilitation, to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation training and the diversification of treatment, and to alleviate the shortage of medical personnel in mainland China and other places in the world. In this preliminary clinical study, three different socially interactive robots with different appearances and functionalities were tested in therapy-like settings in four different rehabilitation facilities/institutions in Shenzhen, China. Seventy-four participants, including 52 children with ASD, whose processes of interacting with robots were recorded by three different cameras, all received a single-session three-robot intervention. Data were collected from not only the videos recorded, but also the questionnaires filled mostly by parents of the participants. Some insights from the preliminary results were obtained. These can contribute to the research on physical robot design and evaluations on robots in therapy-like settings. First, when doing physical robot design, some preferential focus should be on aspects of appearances and functionalities. Second, attention analysis using algorithms such as estimation of the directions of gaze and head posture of a child in the video clips can be adopted to quantitatively measure the prosocial behaviors and actions (e.g., attention shifting from one particular robot to other robots) of the children. Third, observing and calculating the frequency of the time children spend on exploring/playing with the robots in the video clips can be adopted to qualitatively analyze such behaviors and actions. Limitations of the present study are also presented. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This pilot study investigated the development and application of a novel robotic system capable of dynamic, adaptive, and autonomous interaction during imitation tasks with embedded real-time performance evaluation and feedback. The system was designed to incorporate both a humanoid robot and a human examiner. We compared child performance within system across these conditions in a sample of preschool children with ASD (n = 8) and a control sample of typically developing children (n = 8). The system was well-tolerated in the sample, children with ASD exhibited greater attention to the robotic system than the human administrator, and for children with ASD imitation performance appeared superior during the robotic interaction."

Robot control and data analysis methods were combined to assess the quality of interaction between the robot and the subjects. Humanoid robot Zeno was used to execute upper body gestures which the subjects were asked to imitate. The resulting motion of the subject was acquired through a motion capture system and compared with the intended motion performed by Zeno using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. During this study, the clinical hypothesis was that the resulting DTW cost can serve as a quantitative measure for the similarity between the motions, and thus can be used to objectively assess the severity of imitation deficits exhibited by the child. To validate this hypothesis, we present two sets of experiments, one with a set of healthy adults and the other with a group of children, some with autism spectrum disorder. The experiment with adult subjects serves as a statistically significant test to demonstrate the viability of the DTW cost as a similarity measure for the gesture analysis, whereas the experiment with child subjects is a pilot study to differentiate imitation performance for children with autism. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Video Prompting to Teach Robotics and Coding to Middle School Students With Autism Spectrum Disorder,2019,Journal of Special Education Technology,,,,"Wright, J.C. and Knight, V.F. and Barton, E.E. and Edwards-Bowyer, M.",,"Video-based modeling is an evidence-based practice for teaching social and communication skills, functional and daily living skills, and some academic skills (i.e., math) to students with autism spectrum disorder. The efficacy of video-based modeling, however, has not yet been established for STEM skills related to science, technology, or engineering. Drawing on findings from a systematic review of video-based modeling to teach academic skills to students with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability, researchers used a single-case study design to examine the efficacy of video-based modeling for teaching robotics and coding to students with autism spectrum disorder. Specifically, researchers used a multiple probe across skills single-case research design replicated across three middle school participants to teach block-based coding of robots. This afforded three intraparticipant replications and three interparticipant replications. A functional relation between the use of systematic video prompting and mastery of robotics coding skills was demonstrated. Further, to substantiate the social and ecological validity of video-based modeling interventions for public school settings, a special education teacher implemented the intervention in a special education classroom. Additionally, questionnaires were disseminated to study participants and public school special educators naive to the study purpose and outcomes to assess the social validity (i.e., feasibility and effectiveness) of the intervention. © The Author(s) 2019."
Toward a motor signature in autism: Studies from human-machine interaction,2019,Encephale,45,2,182-187,"Xavier, J. and Guedjou, H. and Anzalone, S.M. and Boucenna, S. and Guigon, E. and Chetouani, M. and Cohen, D.",,"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders which core symptoms are impairments in socio-communication and repetitive symptoms and stereotypies. Although not cardinal symptoms per se, motor impairments are fundamental aspects of ASD. These impairments are associated with postural and motor control disabilities that we investigated using computational modeling and developmental robotics through human-machine interaction paradigms. Method: First, in a set of studies involving a human–robot posture imitation, we explored the impact of 3 different groups of partners (including a group of children with ASD) on robot learning by imitation. Second, using an ecological task, i.e. a real-time motor imitation with a tightrope walker (TW) avatar, we investigated interpersonal synchronization, motor coordination and motor control during the task in children with ASD (n = 29), TD children (n = 39) and children with developmental coordination disorder (n = 17, DCD). Results: From the human–robot experiments, we evidenced that motor signature at both groups’ and individuals’ levels had a key influence on imitation learning, posture recognition and identity recognition. From the more dynamic motor imitation paradigm with a TW avatar, we found that interpersonal synchronization, motor coordination and motor control were more impaired in children with ASD compared to both TD children and children with DCD. Taken together these results confirm the motor peculiarities of children with ASD despite imitation tasks were adequately performed. Discussion: Studies from human-machine interaction support the idea of a behavioral signature in children with ASD. However, several issues need to be addressed. Is this behavioral signature motoric in essence? Is it possible to ascertain that these peculiarities occur during all motor tasks (e.g. posture, voluntary movement)? Could this motor signature be considered as specific to autism, notably in comparison to DCD that also display poor motor coordination skills? We suggest that more work comparing the two conditions should be implemented, including analysis of kinematics and movement smoothness with sufficient measurement quality to allow spectral analysis. © 2018 L'Encéphale, Paris"

The aim of the study was to find out how turn-taking games with a robot among the children could encourage social interaction skills in children with autism. Behavioral criteria such as eye gaze and touch were evaluated using video data. Based on our observation, autistic children with low social communication scores have a lower ratio of eye contact compare to autistic children with high social communication. The analysis of behavioral observations also revealed that the autistic children with higher scores of social communication skills directed significantly more eye gaze and touch towards the robot. This finding supports the idea that robot was suitable for encouraging interaction.

Relaxing Gaze Aversion of Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder in Consecutive Conversations With Human and Android Robot-A Preliminary Study.,2019,Frontiers in psychiatry,10,,370,Yoshikawa Y and Kumazaki H and Matsumoto Y and Miyao M and Kikuchi M and Ishiguro H,,"Establishing a treatment method for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) not only to increase their frequency or duration of eye contact but also to maintain it after ceasing the intervention, and furthermore generalize it across communication partners, is a formidable challenge. Android robots, which are a type of humanoid robot with appearances quite similar to that of humans, are expected to adapt to the role of training partners of face-to-face communication for individuals with ASD and to create easier experiences transferrable to humans. To evaluate this possibility, four male adolescents with ASD and six without ASD were asked to participate a pilot experiment in which there were consecutive sessions of semistructured conversation where they alternately faced either a human female or a female-type android robot interlocutor five times in total. Although it is limited by the small sample size, the preliminary results of analysis of their fixation pattern during the conversations indicated positive signs; the subjects tended to look more at the face of the android robot than that of the human interlocutor regardless of whether they had ASD. However, the individuals with ASD looked more at the area around the eyes of the android robot than at the human, and also looked less at that of the human than the individuals without ASD did. An increasing tendency of looking at the area around the human eyes, which could be a positive sign of the transferability of the experiences with an android robot to a human interlocutor, was only weakly observed as the sessions progressed."

The eight-session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping-mode selection, and follow-up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ ≥ 60 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n = 8, 5.75 ± 0.89 years) or control group (CG, n = 7; 6.32 ± 1.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent-completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects’ ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot-facilitated and human-facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

Development of a Semi-Autonomous Robotic System to Assist Children with        Autism in Developing Visual Perspective Taking Skills,2018,2018 27TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ROBOT AND HUMAN INTERACTIVE        COMMUNICATION (IEEE RO-MAN 2018),,,969-976,"Zaraki, A and Wood, LJ and Robins, B and Dautenhahn, K and Zaraki, Abolfazl and Wood, Luke Jai and Robins, Ben and Dautenhahn, Kerstin",IEEE,"Robot-assisted therapy has been successfully used to help children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) develop their social skills, but very often with the robot being fully controlled remotely by an adult operator. Although this method is reliable and allows the operator to conduct a therapy session in a customised child-centred manner, it increases the cognitive workload on the human operator since it requires them to divide their attention between the robot and the child to ensure that the robot is responding appropriately to the child's behaviour. In addition, a remote-controlled robot is not aware of the information regarding the interaction with children (e.g., body gesture and head pose, proximity etc) and consequently it does not have the ability to shape live HRIs. Further to this, a remote-controlled robot typically does not have the capacity to record this information and additional effort is required to analyse the interaction data. For these reasons, using a remote-controlled robot in robot-assisted therapy may be unsustainable for long-term interactions. To lighten the cognitive burden on the human operator and to provide a consistent therapeutic experience, it is essential to create some degrees of autonomy and enable the robot to perform some autonomous behaviours during interactions with children. Our previous research with the Kaspar robot either implemented a fully autonomous scenario involving pairs of children, which then lacked the often important input of the supervising adult, or, in most of our research, has used a remote control in the hand of the adult or the children to operate the robot. Alternatively, this paper provides an overview of the design and implementation of a robotic system called Sense-Think-Act which converts the remote-controlled scenarios of our humanoid robot into a semi-autonomous social agent with the capacity to play games autonomously (under human supervision) with children in the real-world school settings. The developed system has been implemented on the humanoid robot Kaspar and evaluated in a trial with four children with ASC at a local specialist secondary school in the UK where the data of 11 Child-Robot Interactions (CRIs) was collected. The results from this trial demonstrated that the system was successful in providing the robot with appropriate control signals to operate in a semi-autonomous manner without any latency, which supports autonomous CRIs, suggesting that the proposed architecture appears to have promising potential in supporting CRIs for real-world applications."

We present a novel experiment where the classical roles are reversed: in this scenario the children are the teachers providing positive or negative reinforcement to the Kaspar robot in order for it to learn arbitrary associations between different toy names and the locations where they are positioned. The objective is to stimulate interaction and collaboration between children while teaching the robot, and also provide them tangible examples to understand that sometimes learning requires several repetitions. To facilitate this game, we developed a reinforcement learning algorithm enabling Kaspar to verbally convey its level of uncertainty during the learning process, so as to better inform the children about the reasons behind its successes and failures. Overall, 30 typically developing (TD) children aged between 7 and 8 (19 girls, 11 boys) and 9 children with ASD performed 25 sessions (16 for TD; 9 for ASD) of the experiment in groups, and managed to teach Kaspar all associations in 2 to 7 trials. During the course of study Kaspar only made rare unexpected associations (2 perseverative errors and 2 win-shifts, within a total of 314 trials), primarily due to exploratory choices, and eventually reached minimal uncertainty. Thus, the robot’s behaviour was clear and consistent for the children, who all expressed enthusiasm in the experiment. © 2019, The Author(s)."

Twenty 5- to 7-year-old children with ASD and 20 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) children participated in two false belief tasks adapted for robot settings (change-of-location task and the unexpected-contents task). The results showed that most TD children are capable of attributing false belief to the social robot, that is, they could infer higher-level mental states in robots, which extends our understanding in TD children's perception and cognition on social robots. Conversely, children with ASD still show difficulty in interpreting robots' mental states relative to their TD peers, similar as their impaired understanding of human's mind. This group difference in attributing false belief to social robots could not be explained by the different perception and categorization of the robot. Our study implies that although children with ASD appear to be highly attracted by social robots, they still have difficulty in understanding mental states when socially interacting with robots, which should be taken into consideration when designing the robot-based intervention approach targeting to improve social behaviors of ASD. © 2019 Zhang, Song, Tan, Wang, Lam, Hoi, Xiong, Chen and Yi."
Could social robots facilitate children with autism spectrum disorders in learning distrust and deception?,2019,Computers in Human Behavior,98,,140-149,"Zhang, Y. and Song, W. and Tan, Z. and Zhu, H. and Wang, Y. and Lam, C.M. and Weng, Y. and Hoi, S.P. and Lu, H. and Man Chan, B.S. and Chen, J. and Yi, L.",,"Social robots have been increasingly involved in our daily lives and provide a new environment for children's growth. The current study aimed to examine how children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)learned complex social rules from a social robot through distrust and deception games. Twenty children with ASD between the ages of 5–8 and 20 typically-developing (TD)peers whose age and IQ were matched participated in distrust and deception tasks along with an interview about their perception of the human-likeness of the robot. The results demonstrated that: 1)children with ASD were slower to learn to and less likely to distrust and deceive a social robot than TD children and 2)children with ASD who perceived the robot to appear more human-like had more difficulty in learning to distrust the robot. Besides, by comparing to a previous study the results showed that children with ASD appeared to have more difficulty in learning to distrust a human compared to a robot, particularly in the early phase of learning. Overall, our study verified that social robots could facilitate children with ASD's learning of some social rules and showed that children's perception of the robot plays an important role in their social learning, which provides insights on robot design and its clinical applications in ASD intervention. © 2019 The Authors"
Impact of robot-mediated interaction system on joint attention skills for children with autism.,2013,IEEE ... International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics : [proceedings],2013,,6650408,Zheng Z and Zhang L and Bekele E and Swanson A and Crittendon JA and Warren Z and Sarkar N,,"With Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prevalence estimates for children with autism spectrum disorder 1 in 88, identification and effective treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often characterized as a public health emergency. There is an urgent need for more efficacious treatments whose realistic application will yield more substantial impact on the neurodevelopmental trajectories of young children with ASD. Robotic technology appears particularly promising for potential application to ASD intervention. Initial results applying robotic technology to ASD intervention have consistently demonstrated a unique potential to elicit interest and attention in young children with ASD. As such, technologies capable of intelligently harnessing this potential, along with capabilities for detecting and meaningfully responding to young children's attention and behavior, may represent intervention platforms with substantial promise for impacting early symptoms of ASD. Our current work describes development and application of a novel adaptive robot-mediated interaction technology for facilitating early joint attention skills for children with ASD. The system is composed of a humanoid robot endowed with a prompt decision hierarchy to alter behavior in concert with reinforcing stimuli within an intervention environment to promote joint attention skills. Results of implementation of this system over time, including specific analyses of attentional bias and performance enhancement, with 6 young children with ASD are presented."
A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intelligent Robotic Response to Joint Attention Intervention System,2020,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,50,8,2819-2831,"Zheng, Z. and Nie, G. and Swanson, A. and Weitlauf, A. and Warren, Z. and Sarkar, N.",,"Although there has been growing interest in utilizing robots for intervention in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there have been very few controlled trials to assess the actual impacts of such systems on social communication vulnerabilities. This study reports a randomized controlled trial to investigate a robot-mediated response to joint attention intervention in a small (23 recruited; 20 completed) group of young children (average age = 2.54 years) with ASD. Small and nonsignificant group differences were observed regarding improvements in response to joint attention skills within and beyond the intervention. The sample showed tremendous individual variability in response to the system. Results highlight the current challenges related to developing pragmatic, beneficial, and generalizable robotic intervention systems for the targeted population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Design, Development, and Evaluation of a Noninvasive Autonomous Robot-Mediated Joint Attention Intervention System for Young Children with ASD",2018,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,48,2,125-135,"Zheng, Z. and Zhao, H. and Swanson, A.R. and Weitlauf, A.S. and Warren, Z.E. and Sarkar, N.",,"Research indicates that human-robot interaction can help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While most early robot-mediated interaction studies were based on free interactions, recent studies have shown that robot-mediated interventions that focus on the core impairments of ASD such as joint attention deficit tend to produce better outcomes. Joint attention impairment is one of the core deficits in ASD that has an important impact in the neuropsychological development of these children. In this paper, we propose a novel joint attention intervention system for children with ASD that overcomes several existing limitations in this domain such as the need to use body-worn sensors, nonautonomous robot operation requiring human involvement and lack of a formal model for robot-mediated joint attention interaction. We present a fully autonomous robotic system, called noncontact-responsive robot-mediated intervention system, that can infer attention through a distributed noncontact gaze inference mechanism with an embedded least-to-most (LTM) robot-mediated interaction model to address the current limitations. The system was tested in a multisession user study with 14 young children with ASD. The results showed that participants' joint attention skills improved significantly, their interest in the robot remained consistent throughout the sessions, and the LTM interaction model was effective in promoting the children's performance. © 2017 IEEE."
