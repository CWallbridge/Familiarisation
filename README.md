# Familiarisation

This is a repository for researchers to share their familiarisation techniques with others. This repository was originally created as part of the paper "A Systematic Review of Familiarisation Methods Used in Humanâ€“Robot Interactions for Autistic Participants". This paper was published in the International Journal of Social Robotics in 2023. It can be found at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12369-023-01015-y

## Contributing to this repository

We would request that anyone wishing to contribute to repository follow these guidelines:

- Full code or project files used at each stage of a study should be provided. This should be added with the structure /robot_name/robot_version_if_applicable/familiarisation_type/study_short_name  e.g. /nao/v6/capability_demonstration/systematic_review. The code should be documented, preferably with inline comments where appropriate.
- A script used by the experimenter as to what they would say and do during the familiarisation phase of the study. This should include any behaviours of the robot that were triggered by the experimenter.
- The above two items should be bundled with a user guide for the familiarisation. Ideally, this should also include a video of the familiarisation being demonstrated by the research team.
- A readme file that gives an abstract of the study, a brief description of the familiarisation, how to cite the study, and withdrawal data. The withdrawal data should include (even if the value is 0):
  * Withdrawals in pilots.
  * Withdrawals before meeting the robot.
  * Withdrawals during familiarisation.
  * Withdrawals during the main study.
- Papers that use the repository should cite the review, and provide a link to the repository. If using code provided by a particular study, that study should also be cited.
